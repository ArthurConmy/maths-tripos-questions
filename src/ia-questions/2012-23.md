Let $p$ be a prime number, and $a$ an integer with $1 \leqslant a \leqslant p-1$. Let $G$ be the Cartesian product

$$G=\{(x, u) \mid x \in\{0,1, \ldots, p-2\}, u \in\{0,1, \ldots, p-1\}\}$$

Show that the binary operation

$$(x, u) *(y, v)=(z, w)$$

where

$$\begin{aligned}
z & \equiv x+y(\bmod p-1) \\
w & \equiv a^{y} u+v(\bmod p)
\end{aligned}$$

makes $G$ into a group. Show that $G$ is abelian if and only if $a=1$.

Let $H$ and $K$ be the subsets

$$H=\{(x, 0) \mid x \in\{0,1, \ldots, p-2\}\}, \quad K=\{(0, u) \mid u \in\{0,1, \ldots, p-1\}\}$$

of $G$. Show that $K$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, and that $H$ is a subgroup which is normal if and only if $a=1$.

Find a homomorphism from $G$ to another group whose kernel is $K$.
