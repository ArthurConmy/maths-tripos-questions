(a) Explain what is meant by saying that a $2 \times 2$ real transformation matrix

$$\begin{aligned}
&A=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{array}\right) \text { preserves the scalar product with respect to the Euclidean metric } \\
&I=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{array}\right) \text { on } \mathbb{R}^{2} .
\end{aligned}$$

Derive a description of all such matrices that uses a single real parameter together with choices of $\operatorname{sign}(\pm 1)$. Show that these matrices form a group.

(b) Explain what is meant by saying that a $2 \times 2$ real transformation matrix $A=\left(\begin{array}{ll}a & b \\ c & d\end{array}\right)$ preserves the scalar product with respect to the Minkowski metric $J=\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1\end{array}\right)$ on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$

Consider now the set of such matrices with $a>0$. Derive a description of all matrices in this set that uses a single real parameter together with choices of sign $(\pm 1)$. Show that these matrices form a group.

(c) What is the intersection of these two groups?
