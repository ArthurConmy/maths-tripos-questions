(a) Let

$$S L_{2}(\mathbb{Z})=\left\{\left(\begin{array}{ll}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{array}\right) \mid a d-b c=1, \quad a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}$$

and, for a prime $p$, let

$$S L_{2}\left(\mathbb{F}_{p}\right)=\left\{\left(\begin{array}{ll}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{array}\right) \mid a d-b c=1, \quad a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{F}_{p}\right\}$$

where $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ consists of the elements $0,1, \ldots, p-1$, with addition and multiplication mod $p$.

Show that $S L_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ and $S L_{2}\left(\mathbb{F}_{p}\right)$ are groups under matrix multiplication.

[You may assume that matrix multiplication is associative, and that the determinant of a product equals the product of the determinants.]

By defining a suitable homomorphism from $S L_{2}(\mathbb{Z}) \rightarrow S L_{2}\left(\mathbb{F}_{5}\right)$, show that

$$\left\{\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1+5 a & 5 b \\
5 c & 1+5 d
\end{array}\right) \in S L_{2}(\mathbb{Z}) \mid a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}$$

is a normal subgroup of $S L_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$.

(b) Define the group $G L_{2}\left(\mathbb{F}_{5}\right)$, and show that it has order 480 . By defining a suitable homomorphism from $G L_{2}\left(\mathbb{F}_{5}\right)$ to another group, which should be specified, show that the order of $S L_{2}\left(\mathbb{F}_{5}\right)$ is 120 .

Find a subgroup of $G L_{2}\left(\mathbb{F}_{5}\right)$ of index 2 .
