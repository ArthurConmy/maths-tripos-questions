What is an equivalence relation on a set $X ?$ If $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $X$, what is an equivalence class of $\sim$ ? Prove that the equivalence classes of $\sim$ form a partition of $X$.

Let $\sim$ be the relation on the positive integers defined by $x \sim y$ if either $x$ divides $y$ or $y$ divides $x$. Is $\sim$ an equivalence relation? Justify your answer.

Write down an equivalence relation on the positive integers that has exactly four equivalence classes, of which two are infinite and two are finite.
