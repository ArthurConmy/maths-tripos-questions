(a) Find the smallest residue $x$ which equals $28 ! 13^{28}(\bmod 31)$.

[You may use any standard theorems provided you state them correctly.]

(b) Find all integers $x$ which satisfy the system of congruences

$$\begin{aligned}
x & \equiv 1(\bmod 2) \\
2 x & \equiv 1(\bmod 3) \\
2 x & \equiv 4(\bmod 10) \\
x & \equiv 10(\bmod 67)
\end{aligned}$$
