Suppose that $f$ is a Möbius transformation acting on the extended complex plane. Show that a Möbius transformation with at least three fixed points is the identity. Deduce that every Möbius transformation except the identity has one or two fixed points.

Which of the following statements are true and which are false? Justify your answers, quoting standard facts if required.

(i) If $f$ has exactly one fixed point then it is conjugate to $z \mapsto z+1$.

(ii) Every Möbius transformation that fixes $\infty$ may be expressed as a composition of maps of the form $z \mapsto z+a$ and $z \mapsto \lambda z$ (where $a$ and $\lambda$ are complex numbers).

(iii) Every Möbius transformation that fixes 0 may be expressed as a composition of maps of the form $z \mapsto \mu z$ and $z \mapsto 1 / z$ (where $\mu$ is a complex number).

(iv) The operation of complex conjugation defined by $z \mapsto \bar{z}$ is a Möbius transformation.
