What is a 4-vector? Define the inner product of two 4-vectors and give the meanings of the terms timelike, null and spacelike. How do the four components of a 4-vector change under a Lorentz transformation of speed $v$ ? [Without loss of generality, you may take the velocity of the transformation to be along the positive $x$-axis.]

Show that a 4-vector that is timelike in one frame of reference is also timelike in a second frame of reference related by a Lorentz transformation. [Again, you may without loss of generality take the velocity of the transformation to be along the positive $x$-axis.]

Show that any null 4-vector may be written in the form $a(1, \hat{\mathbf{n}})$ where $a$ is real and $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ is a unit 3-vector. Given any two null 4-vectors that are future-pointing, that is, which have positive time-components, show that their sum is either null or timelike.
