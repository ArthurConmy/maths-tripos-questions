Let $\left(a_{n}\right),\left(b_{n}\right)$ be sequences of real numbers. Let $S_{n}=\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{j}$ and set $S_{0}=0$. Show that for any $1 \leqslant m \leqslant n$ we have

$$\sum_{j=m}^{n} a_{j} b_{j}=S_{n} b_{n}-S_{m-1} b_{m}+\sum_{j=m}^{n-1} S_{j}\left(b_{j}-b_{j+1}\right)$$

Suppose that the series $\sum_{n \geqslant 1} a_{n}$ converges and that $\left(b_{n}\right)$ is bounded and monotonic. Does $\sum_{n \geqslant 1} a_{n} b_{n}$ converge?

Assume again that $\sum_{n \geqslant 1} a_{n}$ converges. Does $\sum_{n \geqslant 1} n^{1 / n} a_{n}$ converge?

[You may use the fact that a sequence of real numbers converges if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence.] Paper 1, Section II

10D Analysis I

(a) For real numbers $a, b$ such that $a<b$, let $f:[a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function. Prove that $f$ is bounded on $[a, b]$, and that $f$ attains its supremum and infimum on $[a, b]$.

(b) For $x \in \mathbb{R}$, define

$$g(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
|x|^{\frac{1}{2}} \sin (1 / \sin x), & x \neq n \pi \\
0, & x=n \pi
\end{array} \quad(n \in \mathbb{Z})\right.$$

Find the set of points $x \in \mathbb{R}$ at which $g(x)$ is continuous.

Does $g$ attain its supremum on $[0, \pi] ?$

Does $g$ attain its supremum on $[\pi, 3 \pi / 2]$ ?
