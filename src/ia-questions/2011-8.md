(a) Find the general real solution of the system of first-order differential equations

$$\begin{aligned}
&\dot{x}=x+\mu y \\
&\dot{y}=-\mu x+y,
\end{aligned}$$

where $\mu$ is a real constant.

(b) Find the fixed points of the non-linear system of first-order differential equations

$$\begin{aligned}
&\dot{x}=x+y \\
&\dot{y}=-x+y-2 x^{2} y
\end{aligned}$$

and determine their nature. Sketch the phase portrait indicating the direction of motion along trajectories.
