(a) Let $t_{i j}$ be a rank 2 tensor whose components are invariant under rotations through an angle $\pi$ about each of the three coordinate axes. Show that $t_{i j}$ is diagonal.

(b) An array of numbers $a_{i j}$ is given in one orthonormal basis as $\delta_{i j}+\epsilon_{1 i j}$ and in another rotated basis as $\delta_{i j}$. By using the invariance of the determinant of any rank 2 tensor, or otherwise, prove that $a_{i j}$ is not a tensor.

(c) Let $a_{i j}$ be an array of numbers and $b_{i j}$ a tensor. Determine whether the following statements are true or false. Justify your answers.

(i) If $a_{i j} b_{i j}$ is a scalar for any rank 2 tensor $b_{i j}$, then $a_{i j}$ is a rank 2 tensor.

(ii) If $a_{i j} b_{i j}$ is a scalar for any symmetric rank 2 tensor $b_{i j}$, then $a_{i j}$ is a rank 2 tensor.

(iii) If $a_{i j}$ is antisymmetric and $a_{i j} b_{i j}$ is a scalar for any symmetric rank 2 tensor $b_{i j}$, then $a_{i j}$ is an antisymmetric rank 2 tensor.

(iv) If $a_{i j}$ is antisymmetric and $a_{i j} b_{i j}$ is a scalar for any antisymmetric rank 2 tensor $b_{i j}$, then $a_{i j}$ is an antisymmetric rank 2 tensor.
