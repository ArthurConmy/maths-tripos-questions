State Lagrange's theorem. Show that the order of an element $x$ in a finite group $G$ is finite and divides the order of $G$.

State Cauchy's theorem.

List all groups of order 8 up to isomorphism. Carefully justify that the groups on your list are pairwise non-isomorphic and that any group of order 8 is isomorphic to one on your list. [You may use without proof the Direct Product Theorem and the description of standard groups in terms of generators satisfying certain relations.]
