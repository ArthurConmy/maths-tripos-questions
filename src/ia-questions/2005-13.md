Let $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n} z^{n}$ be a power series in the complex plane with radius of convergence $R$. Show that $\left|a_{n} z^{n}\right|$ is unbounded in $n$ for any $z$ with $|z|>R$. State clearly any results on absolute convergence that are used.

For every $R \in[0, \infty]$, show that there exists a power series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n} z^{n}$ with radius of convergence $R$.
