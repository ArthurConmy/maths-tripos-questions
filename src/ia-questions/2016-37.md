If $\mathbf{v}=\left(v_{1}, v_{2}, v_{3}\right)$ and $\mathbf{w}=\left(w_{1}, w_{2}, w_{3}\right)$ are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, show that $T_{i j}=v_{i} w_{j}$ defines a rank 2 tensor. For which choices of the vectors $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{w}$ is $T_{i j}$ isotropic?

Write down the most general isotropic tensor of rank 2 .

Prove that $\epsilon_{i j k}$ defines an isotropic rank 3 tensor.
