For the dynamical system

$$\ddot{x}=-\sin x$$

find the stable and unstable fixed points and the equation determining the separatrix. Sketch the phase diagram. If the system starts on the separatrix at $x=0$, write down an integral determining the time taken for the velocity $\dot{x}$ to reach zero. Show that the integral is infinite.
