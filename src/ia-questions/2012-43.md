Define what is meant by the terms rotation, reflection, dilation and shear. Give examples of real $2 \times 2$ matrices representing each of these.

Consider the three $2 \times 2$ matrices

$$A=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 1 \\
-1 & 1
\end{array}\right), \quad B=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\begin{array}{ll}
1 & 1 \\
1 & 3
\end{array}\right) \quad \text { and } \quad C=A B$$

Identify the three matrices in terms of your definitions above.
