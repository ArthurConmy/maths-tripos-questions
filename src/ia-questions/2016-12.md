With the help of definitions or equations of your choice, determine the dimensions, in terms of mass $(M)$, length $(L)$, time $(T)$ and charge $(Q)$, of the following quantities:

(i) force;

(ii) moment of a force (i.e. torque);

(iii) energy;

(iv) Newton's gravitational constant $G$;

(v) electric field $\mathbf{E}$;

(vi) magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$;

(vii) the vacuum permittivity $\epsilon_{0}$.
