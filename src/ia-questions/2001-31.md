Prove, by induction or otherwise, that

$$\left(\begin{array}{l}
n \\
0
\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{c}
n+1 \\
1
\end{array}\right)+\cdots+\left(\begin{array}{c}
n+m \\
m
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}
n+m+1 \\
m
\end{array}\right)$$

Find the number of sequences consisting of zeroes and ones that contain exactly $n$ zeroes and at most $m$ ones.
