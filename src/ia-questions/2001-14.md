(i) If $a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots$ are complex numbers show that if, for some $w \in \mathbb{C}, w \neq 0$, the set $\left\{\left|a_{n} w^{n}\right|: n \geq 0\right\}$ is bounded and $|z|<|w|$, then $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n} z^{n}$ converges absolutely. Use this result to define the radius of convergence of the power series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n} z^{n}$.

(ii) If $\left|a_{n}\right|^{1 / n} \rightarrow R$ as $n \rightarrow \infty(0<R<\infty)$ show that $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n} z^{n}$ has radius of convergence equal to $1 / R$.

(iii) Give examples of power series with radii of convergence 1 such that (a) the series converges at all points of the circle of convergence, (b) diverges at all points of the circle of convergence, and (c) neither of these occurs.
