There are $n$ socks in a drawer, three of which are red and the rest black. John chooses his socks by selecting two at random from the drawer and puts them on. He is three times more likely to wear socks of different colours than to wear matching red socks. Find $n$.

For this value of $n$, what is the probability that John wears matching black socks?
