Let $G$ be a finite group and work over $\mathbb{C}$.

(a) Let $\chi$ be a faithful character of $G$, and suppose that $\chi(g)$ takes precisely $r$ different values as $g$ varies over all the elements of $G$. Show that every irreducible character of $G$ is a constituent of one of the powers $\chi^{0}, \chi^{1}, \ldots, \chi^{r-1}$. [Standard properties of the Vandermonde matrix may be assumed if stated correctly.]

(b) Assuming that the number of irreducible characters of $G$ is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of $G$, show that the irreducible characters of $G$ form a basis of the complex vector space of all class functions on $G$. Deduce that $g, h \in G$ are conjugate if and only if $\chi(g)=\chi(h)$ for all characters $\chi$ of $G$.

(c) Let $\chi$ be a character of $G$ which is not faithful. Show that there is some irreducible character $\psi$ of $G$ such that $\left\langle\chi^{n}, \psi\right\rangle=0$ for all integers $n \geqslant 0$.
