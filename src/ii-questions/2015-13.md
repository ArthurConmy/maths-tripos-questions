(i) Let $X$ be a Poisson process of parameter $\lambda$. Let $Y$ be obtained by taking each point of $X$ and, independently of the other points, keeping it with probability $p$. Show that $Y$ is another Poisson process and find its intensity. Show that for every fixed $t$ the random variables $Y_{t}$ and $X_{t}-Y_{t}$ are independent.

(ii) Suppose we have $n$ bins, and balls arrive according to a Poisson process of rate 1 . Upon arrival we choose a bin uniformly at random and place the ball in it. We let $M_{n}$ be the maximum number of balls in any bin at time $n$. Show that

$$\mathbb{P}\left(M_{n} \geqslant(1+\epsilon) \frac{\log n}{\log \log n}\right) \rightarrow 0 \quad \text { as } n \rightarrow \infty$$

[You may use the fact that if $\xi$ is a Poisson random variable of mean 1 , then

$$\mathbb{P}(\xi \geqslant x) \leqslant \exp (x-x \log x) .]$$
