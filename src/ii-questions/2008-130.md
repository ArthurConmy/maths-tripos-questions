Consider the body-centred cuboidal lattice $L$ with lattice points $\left(n_{1} a, n_{2} a, n_{3} b\right)$ and $\left(\left(n_{1}+\frac{1}{2}\right) a,\left(n_{2}+\frac{1}{2}\right) a,\left(n_{3}+\frac{1}{2}\right) b\right)$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive and $n_{1}, n_{2}$ and $n_{3}$ take all possible integer values. Find the reciprocal lattice $\widetilde{L}$ and describe its geometrical form. Calculate the volumes of the unit cells of the lattices $L$ and $\widetilde{L}$.

Find the reciprocal lattice vector associated with the lattice planes parallel to the plane containing the points $(0,0, b),(0, a, b),\left(\frac{1}{2} a, \frac{1}{2} a, \frac{1}{2} b\right),(a, 0,0)$ and $(a, a, 0)$. Deduce the allowed Bragg scattering angles of X-rays off these planes, assuming that $b=\frac{4}{3} a$ and that the X-rays have wavelength $\lambda=\frac{1}{2} a$.
