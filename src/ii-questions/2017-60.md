A horizontal layer of inviscid fluid of density $\rho_{1}$ occupying $0<y<h$ flows with velocity $(U, 0)$ above a horizontal layer of inviscid fluid of density $\rho_{2}>\rho_{1}$ occupying $-h<y<0$ and flowing with velocity $(-U, 0)$, in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$. There are rigid boundaries at $y=\pm h$. The interface between the two layers is perturbed to position $y=\operatorname{Re}\left(A e^{i k x+\sigma t}\right)$.

Write down the full set of equations and boundary conditions governing this flow. Derive the linearised boundary conditions appropriate in the limit $A \rightarrow 0$. Solve the linearised equations to show that the perturbation to the interface grows exponentially in time if

$$U^{2}>\frac{\rho_{2}^{2}-\rho_{1}^{2}}{\rho_{1} \rho_{2}} \frac{g}{4 k} \tanh k h .$$

Sketch the right-hand side of this inequality as a function of $k$. Thereby deduce the minimum value of $U$ that makes the system unstable for all wavelengths.
