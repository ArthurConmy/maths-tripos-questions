(i) Suppose $Y_{1}, \ldots, Y_{n}$ are independent Poisson variables, and

$$\mathbb{E}\left(Y_{i}\right)=\mu_{i}, \quad \log \mu_{i}=\alpha+\beta t_{i}, \quad \text { for } \quad i=1, \ldots, n,$$

where $\alpha, \beta$ are two unknown parameters, and $t_{1}, \ldots, t_{n}$ are given covariates, each of dimension 1. Find equations for $\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta}$, the maximum likelihood estimators of $\alpha, \beta$, and show how an estimate of $\operatorname{var}(\hat{\beta})$ may be derived, quoting any standard theorems you may need.

(ii) By 31 December 2001, the number of new vCJD patients, classified by reported calendar year of onset, were

$$8,10,11,14,17,29,23$$

for the years

$$1994, \ldots, 2000 \text { respectively }$$

Discuss carefully the (slightly edited) $R$ output for these data given below, quoting any standard theorems you may need.
