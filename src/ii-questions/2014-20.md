(a) The action for a one-dimensional dynamical system with a generalized coordinate $q$ and Lagrangian $L$ is given by

$$S=\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} L(q, \dot{q}, t) d t$$

State the principle of least action. Write the expression for the Hamiltonian in terms of the generalized velocity $\dot{q}$, the generalized momentum $p$ and the Lagrangian $L$. Use it to derive Hamilton's equations from the principle of least action.

(b) The motion of a particle of charge $q$ and mass $m$ in an electromagnetic field with scalar potential $\phi(\mathbf{r}, t)$ and vector potential $\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r}, t)$ is characterized by the Lagrangian

$$L=\frac{m \dot{\mathbf{r}}^{2}}{2}-q(\phi-\dot{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{A})$$

(i) Write down the Hamiltonian of the particle.

(ii) Consider a particle which moves in three dimensions in a magnetic field with $\mathbf{A}=(0, B x, 0)$, where $B$ is a constant. There is no electric field. Obtain Hamilton's equations for the particle.
