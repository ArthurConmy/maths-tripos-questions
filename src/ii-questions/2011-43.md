For the map $x_{n+1}=\lambda x_{n}\left(1-x_{n}^{2}\right)$, with $\lambda>0$, show the following:

(i) If $\lambda<1$, then the origin is the only fixed point and is stable.

(ii) If $\lambda>1$, then the origin is unstable. There are two further fixed points which are stable for $1<\lambda<2$ and unstable for $\lambda>2$.

(iii) If $\lambda<3 \sqrt{3} / 2$, then $x_{n}$ has the same sign as the starting value $x_{0}$ if $\left|x_{0}\right|<1$.

(iv) If $\lambda<3$, then $\left|x_{n+1}\right|<2 \sqrt{3} / 3$ when $\left|x_{n}\right|<2 \sqrt{3} / 3$. Deduce that iterates starting sufficiently close to the origin remain bounded, though they may change sign.

[Hint: For (iii) and (iv) a graphical representation may be helpful.]
