(a) A uniform, isotropic dielectric medium occupies the half-space $z>0$. The region $z<0$ is in vacuum. State the boundary conditions that should be imposed on $\mathbf{E}, \mathbf{D}, \mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ at $z=0$.

(b) A linearly polarized electromagnetic plane wave, with magnetic field in the $(x, y)$-plane, is incident on the dielectric from $z<0$. The wavevector $\mathbf{k}$ makes an acute angle $\theta_{I}$ to the normal $\hat{\mathbf{z}}$. If the dielectric has frequency-independent relative permittivity $\epsilon_{r}$, show that the fraction of the incident power that is reflected is

$$\mathcal{R}=\left(\frac{n \cos \theta_{I}-\cos \theta_{T}}{n \cos \theta_{I}+\cos \theta_{T}}\right)^{2}$$

where $n=\sqrt{\epsilon_{r}}$, and the angle $\theta_{T}$ should be specified. [You should ignore any magnetic response of the dielectric.]

(c) Now suppose that the dielectric moves at speed $\beta c$ along the $x$-axis, the incident angle $\theta_{I}=0$, and the magnetic field of the incident radiation is along the $y$-direction. Show that the reflected radiation propagates normal to the surface $z=0$, has the same frequency as the incident radiation, and has magnetic field also along the $y$-direction. [Hint: You may assume that under a standard Lorentz boost with speed $v=\beta c$ along the $x$-direction, the electric and magnetic field components transform as

$$\left(\begin{array}{c}
E_{x}^{\prime} \\
E_{y}^{\prime} \\
E_{z}^{\prime}
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}
E_{x} \\
\gamma\left(E_{y}-v B_{z}\right) \\
\gamma\left(E_{z}+v B_{y}\right)
\end{array}\right) \quad \text { and } \quad\left(\begin{array}{c}
B_{x}^{\prime} \\
B_{y}^{\prime} \\
B_{z}^{\prime}
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}
B_{x} \\
\gamma\left(B_{y}+v E_{z} / c^{2}\right) \\
\gamma\left(B_{z}-v E_{y} / c^{2}\right)
\end{array}\right)$$

where $\gamma=\left(1-\beta^{2}\right)^{-1 / 2}$.]

(d) Show that the fraction of the incident power reflected from the moving dielectric

$$\mathcal{R}_{\beta}=\left(\frac{n / \gamma-\sqrt{1-\beta^{2} / n^{2}}}{n / \gamma+\sqrt{1-\beta^{2} / n^{2}}}\right)^{2}$$
