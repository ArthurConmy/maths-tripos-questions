(a) Define the derived subgroup, $G^{\prime}$, of a finite group $G$. Show that if $\chi$ is a linear character of $G$, then $G^{\prime} \leqslant$ ker $\chi$. Prove that the linear characters of $G$ are precisely the lifts to $G$ of the irreducible characters of $G / G^{\prime}$. [You should state clearly any additional results that you require.]

(b) For $n \geqslant 1$, you may take as given that the group

$$G_{6 n}:=\left\langle a, b: a^{2 n}=b^{3}=1, a^{-1} b a=b^{-1}\right\rangle$$

has order $6 n$.

(i) Let $\omega=e^{2 \pi i / 3}$. Show that if $\varepsilon$ is any $(2 n)$-th root of unity in $\mathbb{C}$, then there is a representation of $G_{6 n}$ over $\mathbb{C}$ which sends

$$a \mapsto\left(\begin{array}{ll}
0 & \varepsilon \\
\varepsilon & 0
\end{array}\right), \quad b \mapsto\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\omega & 0 \\
0 & \omega^{2}
\end{array}\right)$$

(ii) Find all the irreducible representations of $G_{6 n}$.

(iii) Find the character table of $G_{6 n}$.
