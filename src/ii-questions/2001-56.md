(i) Given a differential equation $\dot{x}=f(x)$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, explain what it means to say that the solution is given by a flow $\phi: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}$. Define the orbit, $o(x)$, through a point $x$ and the $\omega$-limit set, $\omega(x)$, of $x$. Define also a homoclinic orbit to a fixed point $x_{0}$. Sketch a flow in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with a homoclinic orbit, and identify (without detailed justification) the $\omega$-limit sets $\omega(x)$ for each point $x$ in your diagram.

(ii) Consider the differential equations

$$\dot{x}=z y, \quad \dot{y}=-z x, \quad \dot{z}=-z^{2} .$$

Transform the equations to polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$ in the $(x, y)$ plane. Solve the equation for $z$ to find $z(t)$, and hence find $\theta(t)$. Hence, or otherwise, determine (with justification) the $\omega$-limit set for all points $\left(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0}\right) \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$.
