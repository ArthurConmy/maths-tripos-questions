For $f: X \rightarrow Y$ a smooth map of manifolds, define the concepts of critical point, critical value and regular value.

With the obvious identification of $\mathbf{C}$ with $\mathbf{R}^{2}$, and hence also of $\mathbf{C}^{3}$ with $\mathbf{R}^{6}$, show that the complex-valued polynomial $z_{1}^{3}+z_{2}^{2}+z_{3}^{2}$ determines a smooth map $f: \mathbf{R}^{6} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^{2}$ whose only critical point is at the origin. Hence deduce that $V:=f^{-1}((0,0)) \backslash\{\mathbf{0}\} \subset \mathbf{R}^{6}$ is a 4-dimensional manifold, and find the equations of its tangent space at any given point $\left(z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}\right) \in V$.

Now let $S^{5} \subset \mathbf{C}^{3}=\mathbf{R}^{6}$ be the unit 5 -sphere, defined by $\left|z_{1}\right|^{2}+\left|z_{2}\right|^{2}+\left|z_{3}\right|^{2}=1$. Given a point $P=\left(z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}\right) \in S^{5} \cap V$, by considering the vector $\left(2 z_{1}, 3 z_{2}, 3 z_{3}\right) \in \mathbf{C}^{3}=\mathbf{R}^{6}$ or otherwise, show that not all tangent vectors to $V$ at $P$ are tangent to $S^{5}$. Deduce that $S^{5} \cap V \subset \mathbf{R}^{6}$ is a compact three-dimensional manifold.
