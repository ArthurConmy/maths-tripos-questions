Consider the dependence of the system

$$\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} &=\left(a-x^{2}\right)\left(a^{2}-y\right) \\
\dot{y} &=x-y
\end{aligned}$$

on the parameter $a$. Find the fixed points and plot their location in the $(a, x)$-plane. Hence, or otherwise, deduce that there are bifurcations at $a=0$ and $a=1$.

Investigate the bifurcation at $a=1$ by making the substitutions $u=x-1, v=y-1$ and $\mu=a-1$. Find the extended centre manifold in the form $v(u, \mu)$ correct to second order. Find the evolution equation on the extended centre manifold to second order, and determine the stability of its fixed points.

Use a plot to show which branches of fixed points in the $(a, x)$-plane are stable and which are unstable, and state, without calculation, the type of bifurcation at $a=0$. Hence sketch the structure of the $(x, y)$ phase plane very close to the origin for $|a| \ll 1$ in the cases (i) $a<0$ and (ii) $a>0$.
