Define the concept of an exponential dispersion family. Show that the family of scaled binomial distributions $\frac{1}{n} \operatorname{Bin}(n, p)$, with $p \in(0,1)$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, is of exponential dispersion family form.

Deduce the mean of the scaled binomial distribution from the exponential dispersion family form.

What is the canonical link function in this case?
