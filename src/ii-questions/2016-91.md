The Fitzhugh-Nagumo model is given by

$$\begin{aligned}
\dot{u} &=c\left(v+u-\frac{1}{3} u^{3}+z(t)\right) \\
\dot{v} &=-\frac{1}{c}(u-a+b v)
\end{aligned}$$

where $\left(1-\frac{2}{3} b\right)<a<1,0<b \leqslant 1$ and $c \gg 1$.

For $z(t)=0$, by considering the nullclines in the $(u, v)$-plane, show that there is a unique equilibrium. Sketch the phase diagram

At $t=0$ the system is at the equilibrium, and $z(t)$ is then 'switched on' to be $z(t)=-V_{0}$ for $t>0$, where $V_{0}$ is a constant. Describe carefully how suitable choices of $V_{0}>0$ can represent a system analogous to (i) a neuron firing once, and (ii) a neuron firing repeatedly. Illustrate your answer with phase diagrams and also plots of $v$ against $t$ for each case. Find the threshold for $V_{0}$ that separates these cases. Comment briefly from a biological perspective on the behaviour of the system when $a=1-\frac{2}{3} b+\epsilon b$ and $0<\epsilon \ll 1$.
