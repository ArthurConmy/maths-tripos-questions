(a) State the fundamental theorem for regular curves in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$.

(b) Let $\alpha: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{3}$ be a regular curve, parameterised by arc length, such that its image $\alpha(\mathbb{R}) \subset \mathbb{R}^{3}$ is a one-dimensional submanifold. Suppose that the set $\alpha(\mathbb{R})$ is preserved by a nontrivial proper Euclidean motion $\phi: \mathbb{R}^{3} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{3}$.

Show that there exists $\sigma_{0} \in \mathbb{R}$ corresponding to $\phi$ such that $\phi(\alpha(s))=\alpha\left(\pm s+\sigma_{0}\right)$ for all $s \in \mathbb{R}$, where the choice of $\pm \operatorname{sign}$ is independent of $s$. Show also that the curvature $k(s)$ and torsion $\tau(s)$ of $\alpha$ satisfy

$$\begin{gathered}
k\left(\pm s+\sigma_{0}\right)=k(s) \text { and } \\
\tau\left(\pm s+\sigma_{0}\right)=\tau(s)
\end{gathered}$$

with equation (2) valid only for $s$ such that $k(s)>0$. In the case where the sign is $+$ and $\sigma_{0}=0$, show that $\alpha(\mathbb{R})$ is a straight line.

(c) Give an explicit example of a curve $\alpha$ satisfying the requirements of (b) such that neither of $k(s)$ and $\tau(s)$ is a constant function, and such that the curve $\alpha$ is closed, i.e. such that $\alpha(s)=\alpha\left(s+s_{0}\right)$ for some $s_{0}>0$ and all $s$. [Here a drawing would suffice.]

(d) Suppose now that $\alpha: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{3}$ is an embedded regular curve parameterised by arc length $s$. Suppose further that $k(s)>0$ for all $s$ and that $k(s)$ and $\tau(s)$ satisfy (1) and (2) for some $\sigma_{0}$, where the choice $\pm$ is independent of $s$, and where $\sigma_{0} \neq 0$ in the case of + sign. Show that there exists a nontrivial proper Euclidean motion $\phi$ such that the set $\alpha(\mathbb{R})$ is preserved by $\phi$. [You may use the theorem of part (a) without proof.]
