What does it mean for a positive definite binary quadratic form to be reduced?

Prove that every positive definite binary quadratic form is equivalent to a reduced form, and that there are only finitely many reduced forms with given discriminant.

State a criterion for a positive integer $n$ to be represented by a positive definite binary quadratic form with discriminant $d<0$, and hence determine which primes $p$ are represented by $x^{2}+x y+7 y^{2}$.
