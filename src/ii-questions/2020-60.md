Consider a two-dimensional horizontal vortex sheet of strength $U$ in a homogeneous inviscid fluid at height $h$ above a horizontal rigid boundary at $y=0$ so that the fluid velocity is

$$\boldsymbol{u}=\left\{\begin{array}{cr}
U \hat{\boldsymbol{x}}, & 0<y<h \\
\mathbf{0}, & h<y
\end{array}\right.$$

(i) Investigate the linear instability of the sheet by determining the relevant dispersion relation for small, inviscid, irrotational perturbations. For what wavelengths is the sheet unstable?

(ii) Evaluate the temporal growth rate and the wave propagation speed in the limits of both short and long waves. Using these results, sketch how the growth rate varies with the wavenumber.

(iii) Comment briefly on how the introduction of a stable density difference (fluid in $y>h$ is less dense than that in $0<y<h$ ) and surface tension at the interface would affect the growth rates.
