(i) Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of the finite group $G$. Without giving detailed proofs, define the process of lifting characters from $G / N$ to $G$. State also the orthogonality relations for $G$.

(ii) Let $a, b$ be the following two permutations in $S_{12}$,

and let $G=\langle a, b\rangle$, a subgroup of $S_{12}$. Prove that $G$ is a group of order 12 and list the conjugacy classes of $G$. By identifying a normal subgroup of $G$ of index 4 and lifting irreducible characters, calculate all the linear characters of $G$. Calculate the complete character table of $G$. By considering 6 th roots of unity, find explicit matrix representations affording the non-linear characters of $G$.
