(a) What is a Lyapunov function?

Consider the dynamical system for $\mathbf{x}(t)=(x(t), y(t))$ given by

$$\begin{aligned}
&\dot{x}=-x+y+x\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) \\
&\dot{y}=-y-2 x+y\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)
\end{aligned}$$

Prove that the origin is asymptotically stable (quoting carefully any standard results that you use).

Show that the domain of attraction of the origin includes the region $x^{2}+y^{2}<r_{1}^{2}$ where the maximum possible value of $r_{1}$ is to be determined.

Show also that there is a region $E=\left\{\mathbf{x} \mid x^{2}+y^{2}>r_{2}^{2}\right\}$ such that $\mathbf{x}(0) \in E$ implies that $|\mathbf{x}(t)|$ increases without bound. Explain your reasoning carefully. Find the smallest possible value of $r_{2}$.

(b) Now consider the dynamical system

$$\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} &=x-y-x\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) \\
\dot{y} &=y+2 x-y\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)
\end{aligned}$$

Prove that this system has a periodic solution (again, quoting carefully any standard results that you use).

Demonstrate that this periodic solution is unique.
