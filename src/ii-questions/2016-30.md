A particle of unit mass is attached to one end of a light, stiff rod of length $\ell$. The other end of the rod is held at a fixed position, such that the rod is free to swing in any direction. Write down the Lagrangian for the system giving a clear definition of any angular variables you introduce. [You should assume the acceleration $g$ is constant.]

Find two independent constants of the motion.

The particle is projected horizontally with speed $v$ from a point where the rod lies at an angle $\alpha$ to the downward vertical, with $0<\alpha<\pi / 2$. In terms of $\ell, g$ and $\alpha$, find the critical speed $v_{c}$ such that the particle always remains at its initial height.

The particle is now projected horizontally with speed $v_{c}$ but from a point at angle $\alpha+\delta \alpha$ to the vertical, where $\delta \alpha / \alpha \ll 1$. Show that the height of the particle oscillates, and find the period of oscillation in terms of $\ell, g$ and $\alpha$.
