(i) What is a geodesic? Show that geodesics are critical points of the energy functional.

(ii) Let $S$ be a surface which admits a parametrization $\phi(u, v)$ defined on an open subset $W$ of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ such that $E=G=U+V$ and $F=0$, where $U=U(u)$ is a function of $u$ alone and $V=V(v)$ is a function of $v$ alone. Let $\gamma: I \rightarrow \phi(W)$ be a geodesic and write $\gamma(t)=\phi(u(t), v(t))$. Show that

$$[U(u(t))+V(v(t))]\left[V(v(t)) \dot{u}^{2}-U(u(t)) \dot{v}^{2}\right]$$

is independent of $t$.
