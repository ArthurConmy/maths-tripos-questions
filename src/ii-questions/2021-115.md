(a) A quantum system with total angular momentum $j_{1}$ is combined with another of total angular momentum $j_{2}$. What are the possible values of the total angular momentum $j$ of the combined system? For given $j$, what are the possible values of the angular momentum along any axis?

(b) Consider the case $j_{1}=j_{2}$. Explain why all the states with $j=2 j_{1}-1$ are antisymmetric under exchange of the angular momenta of the two subsystems, while all the states with $j=2 j_{1}-2$ are symmetric.

(c) An exotic particle $X$ of spin 0 and negative intrinsic parity decays into a pair of indistinguishable particles $Y$. Assume each $Y$ particle has spin 1 and that the decay process conserves parity. Find the probability that the direction of travel of the $Y$ particles is observed to lie at an angle $\theta \in(\pi / 4,3 \pi / 4)$ from some axis along which their total spin is observed to be $+\hbar$ ?
