Consider the dynamical system

$$\begin{aligned}
&\dot{x}=-\mu+x^{2}-y \\
&\dot{y}=y(a-x)
\end{aligned}$$

where $a$ is to be regarded as a fixed real constant and $\mu$ as a real parameter.

Find the fixed points of the system and determine the stability of the system linearized about the fixed points. Hence identify the values of $\mu$ at given $a$ where bifurcations occur.

Describe informally the concepts of centre manifold theory and apply it to analyse the bifurcations that occur in the above system with $a=1$. In particular, for each bifurcation derive an equation for the dynamics on the extended centre manifold and hence classify the bifurcation.

What can you say, without further detailed calculation, about the case $a=0$ ?
