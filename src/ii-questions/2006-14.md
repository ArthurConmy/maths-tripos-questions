Determine whether the following elements of $\operatorname{PSL}_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ are elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic. Justify your answers.

$$\left(\begin{array}{cc}
5 & 8 \\
-2 & -3
\end{array}\right), \quad\left(\begin{array}{cc}
-3 & 1 \\
2 & -1
\end{array}\right)$$

In the case of the first of these transformations find the fixed points.
