(a) State Fatou's lemma.

(b) Let $X$ be a random variable on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and let $\left(X_{k}\right)_{k=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of random variables on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. What does it mean to say that $X_{k} \rightarrow X$ weakly?

State and prove the Central Limit Theorem for i.i.d. real-valued random variables. [You may use auxiliary theorems proved in the course provided these are clearly stated.]

(c) Let $X$ be a real-valued random variable with characteristic function $\varphi$. Let $\left(h_{n}\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of real numbers with $h_{n} \neq 0$ and $h_{n} \rightarrow 0$. Prove that if we have

$$\liminf _{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{2 \varphi(0)-\varphi\left(-h_{n}\right)-\varphi\left(h_{n}\right)}{h_{n}^{2}}<\infty$$

then $\mathbb{E}\left[X^{2}\right]<\infty$
