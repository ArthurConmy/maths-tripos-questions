Define the character $\operatorname{Ind}_{H}^{G} \psi$ of a finite group $G$ which is induced by a character $\psi$ of a subgroup $H$ of $G$.

State and prove the Frobenius reciprocity formula for the characters $\psi$ of $H$ and $\chi$ of $G$.

Now suppose that $H$ has index 2 in $G$. An irreducible character $\psi$ of $H$ and an irreducible character $\chi$ of $G$ are said to be 'related' if

$$\left\langle\operatorname{Ind}_{H}^{G} \psi, \chi\right\rangle_{G}=\left\langle\psi, \operatorname{Res}_{H}^{G} \chi\right\rangle_{H}>0$$

Show that each $\psi$ of degree $d$ is either 'monogamous' in the sense that it is related to one $\chi$ (of degree $2 d$ ), or 'bigamous' in the sense that it is related to precisely two distinct characters $\chi_{1}, \chi_{2}$ (of degree $\left.d\right)$. Show that each $\chi$ is related to one bigamous $\psi$, or to two monogamous characters $\psi_{1}, \psi_{2}$ (of the same degree).

Write down the degrees of the complex irreducible characters of the alternating group $A_{5}$. Find the degrees of the irreducible characters of a group $G$ containing $A_{5}$ as a subgroup of index 2 , distinguishing two possible cases.
