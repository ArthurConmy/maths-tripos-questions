A self-gravitating fluid with density $\rho$, pressure $P(\rho)$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ in a gravitational potential $\Phi$ obeys the equations

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}+\nabla \cdot(\rho \mathbf{v}) &=0 \\
\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t}+(\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{v}+\frac{\nabla P}{\rho}+\nabla \Phi &=\mathbf{0} \\
\nabla^{2} \Phi &=4 \pi G \rho
\end{aligned}$$

Assume that there exists a static constant solution of these equations with $\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{0}, \rho=\rho_{0}$ and $\Phi=\Phi_{0}$, for which $\nabla \Phi_{0}$ can be neglected. This solution is perturbed. Show that, to first order in the perturbed quantities, the density perturbations satisfy

$$\frac{\partial^{2} \rho_{1}}{\partial t^{2}}=c_{s}^{2} \nabla^{2} \rho_{1}+4 \pi G \rho_{0} \rho_{1}$$

where $\rho=\rho_{0}+\rho_{1}(\mathbf{x}, t)$ and $c_{s}^{2}=d P / d \rho$. Show that there are solutions to this equation of the form

$$\rho_{1}(\mathbf{x}, t)=A \exp [-i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x}+i \omega t]$$

where $A, \omega$ and $\mathbf{k}$ are constants and

$$\omega^{2}=c_{s}^{2} \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{k}-4 \pi G \rho_{0}$$

Interpret these solutions physically in the limits of small and large $|\mathbf{k}|$, explaining what happens to density perturbations on large and small scales, and determine the critical wavenumber that divides the two distinct behaviours of the perturbation.
