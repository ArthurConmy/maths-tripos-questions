(i) Let $K \subseteq L$ be a field extension and $f \in K[t]$ be irreducible of positive degree. Prove the theorem which states that there is a $1-1$ correspondence

$$\operatorname{Root}_{f}(L) \longleftrightarrow \operatorname{Hom}_{K}\left(\frac{K[t]}{\langle f\rangle}, L\right)$$

(ii) Let $K$ be a field and $f \in K[t]$. What is a splitting field for $f$ ? What does it mean to say $f$ is separable? Show that every $f \in K[t]$ is separable if $K$ is a finite field.

(iii) The primitive element theorem states that if $K \subseteq L$ is a finite separable field extension, then $L=K(\alpha)$ for some $\alpha \in L$. Give the proof of this theorem assuming $K$ is infinite.
