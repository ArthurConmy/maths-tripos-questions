(a) What does it mean to say that a graph $G$ is strongly regular with parameters $(k, a, b) ?$

(b) Let $G$ be an incomplete, strongly regular graph with parameters $(k, a, b)$ and of order $n$. Suppose $b \geqslant 1$. Show that the numbers

$$\frac{1}{2}\left(n-1 \pm \frac{(n-1)(b-a)-2 k}{\sqrt{(a-b)^{2}+4(k-b)}}\right)$$

are integers.

(c) Suppose now that $G$ is an incomplete, strongly regular graph with parameters $(k, 0,3)$. Show that $|G| \in\{6,162\}$.
