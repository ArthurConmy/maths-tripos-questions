A policy $\pi$ is to be chosen to maximize

$$F(\pi, x)=\mathbb{E}_{\pi}\left[\sum_{t \geqslant 0} \beta^{t} r\left(x_{t}, u_{t}\right) \mid x_{0}=x\right]$$

where $0<\beta \leqslant 1$. Assuming that $r \geqslant 0$, prove that $\pi$ is optimal if $F(\pi, x)$ satisfies the optimality equation.

An investor receives at time $t$ an income of $x_{t}$ of which he spends $u_{t}$, subject to $0 \leqslant u_{t} \leqslant x_{t}$. The reward is $r\left(x_{t}, u_{t}\right)=u_{t}$, and his income evolves as

$$x_{t+1}=x_{t}+\left(x_{t}-u_{t}\right) \varepsilon_{t},$$

where $\left(\varepsilon_{t}\right)_{t \geqslant 0}$ is a sequence of independent random variables with common mean $\theta>0$. If $0<\beta \leqslant 1 /(1+\theta)$, show that the optimal policy is to take $u_{t}=x_{t}$ for all $t$.

What can you say about the problem if $\beta>1 /(1+\theta) ?$
