(i) Define the $M / M / 1$ queue with arrival rate $\lambda$ and service rate $\mu$. Find conditions on the parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$ for the queue to be transient, null recurrent, and positive recurrent, briefly justifying your answers. In the last case give with justification the invariant distribution explicitly. Answer the same questions for an $M / M / \infty$ queue.

(ii) At a taxi station, customers arrive at a rate of 3 per minute, and taxis at a rate of 2 per minute. Suppose that a taxi will wait no matter how many other taxis are present. However, if a person arriving does not find a taxi waiting he or she leaves to find alternative transportation.

Find the long-run proportion of arriving customers who get taxis, and find the average number of taxis waiting in the long run.

An agent helps to assign customers to taxis, and so long as there are taxis waiting he is unable to have his coffee. Once a taxi arrives, how long will it take on average before he can have another sip of his coffee?
