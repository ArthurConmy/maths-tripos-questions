(i) Let $X=\left\{(x, y) \in \mathbb{C}^{2} \mid x^{2}=y^{3}\right\}$. Show that $X$ is birational to $\mathbf{A}^{1}$, but not isomorphic to it.

(ii) Let $X$ be an affine variety. Define the dimension of $X$ in terms of the tangent spaces of $X$.

(iii) Let $f \in k\left[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right]$ be an irreducible polynomial, where $k$ is an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic. Show that $\operatorname{dim} Z(f)=n-1$.
