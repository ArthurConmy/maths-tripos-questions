Let $\alpha: I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{3}$ be a smooth curve parametrized by arc-length, with $\alpha^{\prime \prime}(s) \neq 0$ for all $s \in I$. Define what is meant by the Frenet frame $t(s), n(s), b(s)$, the curvature and torsion of $\alpha$. State and prove the Frenet formulae.

By considering $\langle\alpha, t \times n\rangle$, or otherwise, show that, if for each $s \in I$ the vectors $\alpha(s)$, $t(s)$ and $n(s)$ are linearly dependent, then $\alpha(s)$ is a plane curve.

State and prove the isoperimetric inequality for $C^{1}$ regular plane curves.

[You may assume Wirtinger's inequality, provided you state it accurately.]
