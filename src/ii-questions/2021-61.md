Consider a steady axisymmetric flow with components $(-\alpha r, v(r), 2 \alpha z)$ in cylindrical polar coordinates $(r, \theta, z)$, where $\alpha$ is a positive constant. The fluid has density $\rho$ and kinematic viscosity $\nu$.

(a) Briefly describe the flow and confirm that it is incompressible.

(b) Show that the vorticity has one component $\omega(r)$, in the $z$ direction. Write down the corresponding vorticity equation and derive the solution

$$\omega=\omega_{0} e^{-\alpha r^{2} /(2 \nu)}$$

Hence find $v(r)$ and show that it has a maximum at some finite radius $r^{*}$, indicating how $r^{*}$ scales with $\nu$ and $\alpha$.

(c) Find an expression for the net advection of angular momentum, prv, into the finite cylinder defined by $r \leqslant r_{0}$ and $-z_{0} \leqslant z \leqslant z_{0}$. Show that this is always positive and asymptotes to the value

$$\frac{8 \pi \rho z_{0} \omega_{0} \nu^{2}}{\alpha}$$

as $r_{0} \rightarrow \infty$

(d) Show that the torque exerted on the cylinder of part (c) by the exterior flow is always negative and demonstrate that it exactly balances the net advection of angular momentum. Comment on why this has to be so.

[You may assume that for a flow $(u, v, w)$ in cylindrical polar coordinates

$$\begin{aligned}
& e_{r \theta}=\frac{r}{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\frac{v}{r}\right)+\frac{1}{2 r} \frac{\partial u}{\partial \theta}, \quad e_{\theta z}=\frac{1}{2 r} \frac{\partial w}{\partial \theta}+\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial v}{\partial z}, \quad e_{r z}=\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial u}{\partial z}+\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial w}{\partial r} \\
& \text { and } \left.\boldsymbol{\omega}=\frac{1}{r}\left|\begin{array}{ccc}\mathbf{e}_{r} & r \mathbf{e}_{\theta} & \mathbf{e}_{z} \\\partial / \partial r & \partial / \partial \theta & \partial / \partial z \\u & r v & w\end{array}\right| .\right] 
\end{aligned}$$
