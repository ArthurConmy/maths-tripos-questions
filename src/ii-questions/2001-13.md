State the optimal distribution problem. Carefully describe the simplex-on-a-graph algorithm for solving optimal distribution problems when the flow in each arc in the network is constrained to lie in the interval $[0, \infty)$. Explain how the algorithm can be initialised if there is no obvious feasible solution with which to begin. Describe the adjustments that are needed for the algorithm to cope with more general capacity constraints $x(j) \in\left[c^{-}(j), c^{+}(j)\right]$ for each arc $j$ (where $c^{\pm}(j)$ may be finite or infinite).
