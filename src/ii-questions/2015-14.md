(i) Defne a Poisson process on $\mathbb{R}_{+}$with rate $\lambda$. Let $N$ and $M$ be two independent Poisson processes on $\mathbb{R}_{+}$of rates $\lambda$ and $\mu$ respectively. Prove that $N+M$ is also a Poisson process and find its rate.

(ii) Let $X$ be a discrete time Markov chain with transition matrix $K$ on the finite state space $S$. Find the generator of the continuous time Markov chain $Y_{t}=X_{N_{t}}$ in terms of $K$ and $\lambda$. Show that if $\pi$ is an invariant distribution for $X$, then it is also invariant for $Y$.

Suppose that $X$ has an absorbing state $a$. If $\tau_{a}$ and $T_{a}$ are the absorption times for $X$ and $Y$ respectively, write an equation that relates $\mathbb{E}_{x}\left[\tau_{a}\right]$ and $\mathbb{E}_{x}\left[T_{a}\right]$, where $x \in S$.

[Hint: You may want to prove that if $\xi_{1}, \xi_{2}, \ldots$ are i.i.d. non-negative random variables with $\mathbb{E}\left[\xi_{1}\right]<\infty$ and $M$ is an independent non-negative random variable, then $\left.\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{i=1}^{M} \xi_{i}\right]=\mathbb{E}[M] \mathbb{E}\left[\xi_{1}\right] .\right]$
