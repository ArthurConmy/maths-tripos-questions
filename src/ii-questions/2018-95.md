An activator-inhibitor reaction diffusion system is given, in dimensionless form, by

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=d \frac{\partial^{2} u}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{u^{2}}{v}-2 b u, \quad \frac{\partial v}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial^{2} v}{\partial x^{2}}+u^{2}-v$$

where $d$ and $b$ are positive constants. Which symbol represents the concentration of activator and which the inhibitor? Determine the positive steady states and show, by an examination of the eigenvalues in a linear stability analysis of the spatially uniform situation, that the reaction kinetics are stable if $b<\frac{1}{2}$.

Determine the conditions for the steady state to be driven unstable by diffusion, and sketch the $(b, d)$ parameter space in which the diffusion-driven instability occurs. Find the critical wavenumber $k_{c}$ at the bifurcation to such a diffusion-driven instability.
