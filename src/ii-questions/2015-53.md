Define what is meant by the Cauchy principal value in the particular case

$$\mathcal{P} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\cos x}{x^{2}-a^{2}} d x$$

where the constant $a$ is real and strictly positive. Evaluate this expression explicitly, stating clearly any standard results involving contour integrals that you use.
