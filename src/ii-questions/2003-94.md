Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth manifolds. If $\pi: M \times N \rightarrow M$ is the projection onto the first factor and $\pi^{*}$ is the map in cohomology induced by the pull-back map on differential forms, show that $\pi^{*}\left(H^{k}(M)\right)$ is a direct summand of $H^{k}(M \times N)$ for each $k \geqslant 0$.

Taking $H^{k}(M)$ to be zero for $k<0$ and $k>\operatorname{dim} M$, show that for $n \geqslant 1$ and all $k$

$$H^{k}\left(M \times S^{n}\right) \cong H^{k}(M) \oplus H^{k-n}(M)$$

[You might like to use induction in n.]
