An expanding universe with scale factor $a(t)$ is filled with (pressure-free) cold dark matter (CDM) of average mass density $\bar{\rho}(t)$. In the Zel'dovich approximation to gravitational clumping, the perturbed position $\mathbf{r}(\mathbf{q}, t)$ of a CDM particle with unperturbed comoving position $\mathbf{q}$ is given by

$$\mathbf{r}(\mathbf{q}, t)=a(t)[\mathbf{q}+\boldsymbol{\psi}(\mathbf{q}, t)]$$

where $\psi$ is the comoving displacement.

(i) Explain why the conservation of CDM particles implies that

$$\rho(\mathbf{r}, t) d^{3} r=a^{3} \bar{\rho}(t) d^{3} q,$$

where $\rho(\mathbf{r}, t)$ is the CDM mass density. Use (1) to verify that $d^{3} q=a^{-3}\left[1-\nabla_{\mathbf{q}} \cdot \psi\right] d^{3} r$, and hence deduce that the fractional density perturbation is, to first order,

$$\delta \equiv \frac{\rho-\bar{\rho}}{\bar{\rho}}=-\nabla_{\mathbf{q}} \cdot \psi \text {. }$$

Use this result to integrate the Poisson equation $\nabla^{2} \Phi=4 \pi G \bar{\rho}$ for the gravitational potential $\Phi$. Then use the particle equation of motion $\ddot{\mathbf{r}}=-\nabla \Phi$ to deduce a second-order differential equation for $\psi$, and hence that

$$\ddot{\delta}+2\left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right) \dot{\delta}-4 \pi G \bar{\rho} \delta=0 .$$

[You may assume that $\nabla^{2} \Phi=4 \pi G \bar{\rho}$ implies $\nabla \Phi=(4 \pi G / 3) \bar{\rho} \mathbf{r}$ and that the pressure-free acceleration equation is $\ddot{a}=-(4 \pi G / 3) \bar{\rho} a .]$

(ii) A flat matter-dominated universe with background density $\bar{\rho}=\left(6 \pi G t^{2}\right)^{-1}$ has scale factor $a(t)=\left(t / t_{0}\right)^{2 / 3}$. The universe is filled with a pressure-free homogeneous (non-clumping) fluid of mass density $\rho_{H}(t)$, as well as cold dark matter of mass density $\rho_{C}(\mathbf{r}, t)$.

Assuming that the Zel'dovich perturbation equation in this case is as in (2) but with $\bar{\rho}$ replaced by $\bar{\rho}_{C}$, i.e. that

$$\ddot{\delta}+2\left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right) \dot{\delta}-4 \pi G \bar{\rho}_{C} \delta=0,$$

seek power-law solutions $\delta \propto t^{\alpha}$ to find growing and decaying modes with

$$\alpha=\frac{1}{6}\left(-1 \pm \sqrt{25-24 \Omega_{H}}\right)$$

where $\Omega_{H}=\rho_{H} / \bar{\rho}$.

Given that matter domination starts $\left(t=t_{\text {eq }}\right)$ at a redshift $z \approx 10^{5}$, and given an initial perturbation $\delta\left(t_{\mathrm{eq}}\right) \approx 10^{-5}$, show that $\Omega_{H}=2 / 3$ yields a model that is not compatible with the large-scale structure observed today.
