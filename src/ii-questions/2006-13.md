Compute the area of the ball of radius $r$ around a point in the hyperbolic plane. Deduce that, for any tessellation of the hyperbolic plane by congruent, compact tiles, the number of tiles which are at most $n$ "steps" away from a given tile grows exponentially in $n$. Give an explicit example of a tessellation of the hyperbolic plane.
