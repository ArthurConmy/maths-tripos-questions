Let $u_{t}=K\left(x, u, u_{x}, \ldots\right)$ be an evolution equation for the function $u=u(x, t)$. Assume $u$ and all its derivatives decay rapidly as $|x| \rightarrow \infty$. What does it mean to say that the evolution equation for $u$ can be written in Hamiltonian form?

The modified KdV (mKdV) equation for $u$ is

$$u_{t}+u_{x x x}-6 u^{2} u_{x}=0 .$$

Show that small amplitude solutions to this equation are dispersive.

Demonstrate that the mKdV equation can be written in Hamiltonian form and define the associated Poisson bracket $\{,$,$} on the space of functionals of u$. Verify that the Poisson bracket is linear in each argument and anti-symmetric.

Show that a functional $I=I[u]$ is a first integral of the mKdV equation if and only if $\{I, H\}=0$, where $H=H[u]$ is the Hamiltonian.

Show that if $u$ satisfies the mKdV equation then

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(u^{2}\right)+\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(2 u u_{x x}-u_{x}^{2}-3 u^{4}\right)=0$$

Using this equation, show that the functional

$$I[u]=\int u^{2} d x$$

Poisson-commutes with the Hamiltonian.
