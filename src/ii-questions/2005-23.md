What does it mean to transmit reliably at rate $r$ through a binary symmetric channel (BSC) with error probability $p$ ? Assuming Shannon's second coding theorem, compute the supremum of all possible reliable transmission rates of a BSC. What happens if (i) $p$ is very small, (ii) $p=1 / 2$, or (iii) $p>1 / 2$ ?
