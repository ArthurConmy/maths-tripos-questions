Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{2}$ be a domain (connected open subset) with boundary $\partial \Omega$ a continuously differentiable simple closed curve. Denoting by $A(\Omega)$ the area of $\Omega$ and $l(\partial \Omega)$ the length of the curve $\partial \Omega$, state and prove the isoperimetric inequality relating $A(\Omega)$ and $l(\partial \Omega)$ with optimal constant, including the characterization for equality. [You may appeal to Wirtinger's inequality as long as you state it precisely.]

Does the result continue to hold if the boundary $\partial \Omega$ is allowed finitely many points at which it is not differentiable? Briefly justify your answer by giving either a counterexample or an indication of a proof.
