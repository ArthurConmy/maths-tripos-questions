Write down the classical Hamiltonian for a particle of mass $m$, electric charge $-e$ and momentum p moving in the background of an electromagnetic field with vector and scalar potentials $\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{x}, t)$ and $\phi(\mathbf{x}, t)$.

Consider the case of a constant uniform magnetic field, $\mathbf{B}=(0,0, B)$ and $\mathbf{E}=0$. Working in the gauge with $\mathbf{A}=(-B y, 0,0)$ and $\phi=0$, show that Hamilton's equations,

$$\dot{\mathbf{x}}=\frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{p}}, \quad \dot{\mathbf{p}}=-\frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{x}},$$

admit solutions corresponding to circular motion in the $x-y$ plane with angular frequency $\omega_{B}=e B / m$.

Show that, in the same gauge, the coordinates $\left(x_{0}, y_{0}, 0\right)$ of the centre of the circle are related to the instantaneous position $\mathbf{x}=(x, y, z)$ and momentum $\mathbf{p}=\left(p_{x}, p_{y}, p_{z}\right)$ of the particle by

$$x_{0}=x-\frac{p_{y}}{e B}, \quad y_{0}=\frac{p_{x}}{e B} .$$

Write down the quantum Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ for the system. In the case of a uniform constant magnetic field discussed above, find the allowed energy levels. Working in the gauge specified above, write down quantum operators corresponding to the classical quantities $x_{0}$ and $y_{0}$ defined in (1) above and show that they are conserved.

[In this question you may use without derivation any facts relating to the energy spectrum of the quantum harmonic oscillator provided they are stated clearly.]
