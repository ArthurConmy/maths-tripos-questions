(i) State and prove a result of Euler relating the number of vertices, edges and faces of a plane graph. Use this result to exhibit a non-planar graph.

(ii) State the vertex form of Menger's Theorem and explain how it follows from an appropriate version of the Max-flow-min-cut Theorem. Let $k \geqslant 2$. Show that every $k$-connected graph of order at least $2 k$ contains a cycle of length at least $2 k$.
