Give the definitions of the convolution $f * g$ and of the Fourier transform $\widehat{f}$ of $f$, and show that $\widehat{f * g}=\widehat{f} \widehat{g}$. State what it means for Fourier inversion to hold for a function $f$.

State the Plancherel identity and compute the $L^{2}$ norm of the Fourier transform of the function $f(x)=e^{-x} \mathbf{1}_{[0,1]}$.

Suppose that $\left(f_{n}\right), f$ are functions in $L^{1}$ such that $f_{n} \rightarrow f$ in $L^{1}$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. Show that $\widehat{f}_{n} \rightarrow \widehat{f}$ uniformly.

Give the definition of weak convergence, and state and prove the Central Limit Theorem.
