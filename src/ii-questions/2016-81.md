(a) State the closed graph theorem.

(b) Prove the closed graph theorem assuming the inverse mapping theorem.

(c) Let $X, Y, Z$ be Banach spaces and $T: X \rightarrow Y, S: Y \rightarrow Z$ be linear maps. Suppose that $S \circ T$ is bounded and $S$ is both bounded and injective. Show that $T$ is bounded.
