The population densities of two types of cell are given by $U(x, t)$ and $V(x, t)$. The system is described by the equations

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial U}{\partial t} &=\alpha U(1-U)+\chi \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(U \frac{\partial V}{\partial x}\right)+D \frac{\partial^{2} U}{\partial x^{2}} \\
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} &=V(1-V)-\beta U V+\frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial x^{2}}
\end{aligned}$$

where $\alpha, \beta, \chi$ and $D$ are positive constants.

(a) Identify the terms which involve interaction between the cell types, and briefly describe what each of these terms might represent.

(b) Consider the system without spatial dynamics. Find the condition on $\beta$ for there to be a non-trivial spatially homogeneous solution that is stable to spatially invariant disturbances.

(c) Consider now the full spatial system, and consider small spatial perturbations proportional to $\cos (k x)$ of the solution found in part (b). Show that for sufficiently large $\chi$ (the precise threshold should be found) the spatially homogeneous solution is stable to perturbations with either small or large wavenumber, but is unstable to perturbations at some intermediate wavenumber.
