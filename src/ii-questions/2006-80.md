State the simplicial approximation theorem. Compute the number of 0 -simplices (vertices) in the barycentric subdivision of an $n$-simplex and also compute the number of $n$-simplices. Finally, show that there are at most countably many homotopy classes of continuous maps from the 2-sphere to itself.
