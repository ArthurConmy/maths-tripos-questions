The scattering amplitude for electrons of momentum $\hbar \mathbf{k}$ incident on an atom located at the origin is $f(\hat{\mathbf{r}})$ where $\hat{\mathbf{r}}=\mathbf{r} / r$. Explain why, if the atom is displaced by a position vector a, the asymptotic form of the scattering wave function becomes

$$\psi_{\mathbf{k}}(\mathbf{r}) \sim e^{i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}}+e^{i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{a}} \frac{e^{i k r^{\prime}}}{r^{\prime}} f\left(\hat{\mathbf{r}}^{\prime}\right) \sim e^{i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}}+e^{i\left(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k}^{\prime}\right) \cdot \mathbf{a}} \frac{e^{i k r}}{r} f(\hat{\mathbf{r}}),$$

where $\mathbf{r}^{\prime}=\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{a}, r^{\prime}=\left|\mathbf{r}^{\prime}\right|, \hat{\mathbf{r}}^{\prime}=\mathbf{r}^{\prime} / r^{\prime}$ and $k=|\mathbf{k}|, \mathbf{k}^{\prime}=k \hat{\mathbf{r}}$. For electrons incident on $N$ atoms in a regular Bravais crystal lattice show that the differential cross-section for scattering in the direction $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ is

$$\frac{d \sigma}{d \Omega}=N|f(\hat{\mathbf{r}})|^{2} \Delta\left(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k}^{\prime}\right) .$$

Derive an explicit form for $\Delta(\mathbf{Q})$ and show that it is strongly peaked when $\mathbf{Q} \approx \mathbf{b}$ for $\mathbf{b}$ a reciprocal lattice vector.

State the Born approximation for $f(\hat{\mathbf{r}})$ when the scattering is due to a potential $V(\mathbf{r})$. Calculate the Born approximation for the case $V(\mathbf{r})=-a \delta(\mathbf{r}) .$

Electrons with de Broglie wavelength $\lambda$ are incident on a target composed of many randomly oriented small crystals. They are found to be scattered strongly through an angle of $60^{\circ}$. What is the likely distance between planes of atoms in the crystal responsible for the scattering?
