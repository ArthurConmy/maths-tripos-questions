(i) Define a Poisson process $\left(N_{t}, t \geqslant 0\right)$ with intensity $\lambda$. Specify without justification the distribution of $N_{t}$. Let $T_{1}, T_{2}, \ldots$ denote the jump times of $\left(N_{t}, t \geqslant 0\right)$. Derive the joint distribution of $\left(T_{1}, \ldots, T_{n}\right)$ given $\left\{N_{t}=n\right\}$.

(ii) Let $\left(N_{t}, t \geqslant 0\right)$ be a Poisson process with intensity $\lambda>0$ and let $X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots$ be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables, independent of $\left(N_{t}, t \geqslant 0\right)$, all having the same distribution as a random variable $X$. Show that if $g(s, x)$ is a real-valued function of real variables $s, x$, and $T_{j}$ are the jump times of $\left(N_{t}, t \geqslant 0\right)$ then

$$\mathbb{E}\left[\exp \left\{\theta \sum_{j=1}^{N_{t}} g\left(T_{j}, X_{j}\right)\right\}\right]=\exp \left\{\lambda \int_{0}^{t}\left(\mathbb{E}\left(e^{\theta g(s, X)}\right)-1\right) d s\right\}$$

for all $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$. [Hint: Condition on $\left\{N_{t}=n\right\}$ and $T_{1}, \ldots, T_{n}$, using (i).]

(iii) A university library is open from 9 am to $5 \mathrm{pm}$. Students arrive at times of a Poisson process with intensity $\lambda$. Each student spends a random amount of time in the library, independently of the other students. These times are identically distributed for all students and have the same distribution as a random variable $X$. Show that the number of students in the library at $5 \mathrm{pm}$ is a Poisson random variable with a mean that you should specify.
