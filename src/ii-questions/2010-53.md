An axisymmetric incompressible Stokes flow has the Stokes stream function $\Psi(R, \theta)$ in spherical polar coordinates $(R, \theta, \phi)$. Give expressions for the components $u_{R}, u_{\theta}$ of the flow field in terms of $\Psi$. Show that the equation satisfied by $\Psi$ is

$$\mathcal{D}^{2}\left(\mathcal{D}^{2} \Psi\right)=0, \quad \text { where } \quad \mathcal{D}^{2}=\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial R^{2}}+\frac{\sin \theta}{R^{2}} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(\frac{1}{\sin \theta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\right)$$

Fluid is contained between the two spheres $R=a, R=b$, with $b \gg a$. The fluid velocity vanishes on the outer sphere, while on the inner sphere $u_{R}=U \cos \theta, u_{\theta}=0$. It is assumed that Stokes flow applies.

(i) Show that the Stokes stream function,

$$\Psi(R, \theta)=a^{2} U \sin ^{2} \theta\left(A\left(\frac{a}{R}\right)+B\left(\frac{R}{a}\right)+C\left(\frac{R}{a}\right)^{2}+D\left(\frac{R}{a}\right)^{4}\right)$$

is the general solution of $(*)$ proportional to $\sin ^{2} \theta$ and write down the conditions on $A, B, C, D$ that allow all the boundary conditions to be satisfied.

(ii) Now let $b \rightarrow \infty$, with $|\mathbf{u}| \rightarrow 0$ as $R \rightarrow \infty$. Show that $A=B=1 / 4$ with $C=D=0$.

(iii) Show that when $b / a$ is very large but finite, then the coefficients have the approximate form

$$C \approx-\frac{3}{8} \frac{a}{b}, \quad D \approx \frac{1}{8} \frac{a^{3}}{b^{3}}, \quad A \approx \frac{1}{4}-\frac{3}{16} \frac{a}{b}, \quad B \approx \frac{1}{4}+\frac{9}{16} \frac{a}{b}$$
