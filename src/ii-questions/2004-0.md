(i) What is a geodesic on a surface $M$ with Riemannian metric, and what are geodesic polar co-ordinates centred at a point $P$ on $M$ ? State, without proof, formulae for the Riemannian metric and the Gaussian curvature in terms of geodesic polar co-ordinates.

(ii) Show that a surface with constant Gaussian curvature 0 is locally isometric to the Euclidean plane.
