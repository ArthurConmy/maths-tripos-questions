Given a complete analytic function $\mathcal{F}$ on a domain $U \subset \mathbb{C}$, describe briefly how the space of germs construction yields a Riemann surface $R$ associated to $\mathcal{F}$ together with a covering map $\pi: R \rightarrow U$ (proofs not required).

In the case when $\pi$ is regular, explain briefly how, given a point $P \in U$, any closed curve in $U$ with initial and final points $P$ yields a permutation of the set $\pi^{-1}(P)$.

Now consider the Riemann surface $R$ associated with the complete analytic function

$$\left(z^{2}-1\right)^{1 / 2}+\left(z^{2}-4\right)^{1 / 2}$$

on $U=\mathbb{C} \backslash\{\pm 1, \pm 2\}$, with regular covering map $\pi: R \rightarrow U$. Which subgroup of the full symmetric group of $\pi^{-1}(P)$ is obtained in this way from all such closed curves (with initial and final points $P)$ ?
