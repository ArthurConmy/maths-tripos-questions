(a) Let $Y$ be an $n$-vector of responses from the linear model $Y=X \beta+\varepsilon$, with $\beta \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$. The internally studentized residual is defined by

$$s_{i}=\frac{Y_{i}-x_{i}^{\top} \hat{\beta}}{\tilde{\sigma} \sqrt{1-p_{i}}},$$

where $\hat{\beta}$ is the least squares estimate, $p_{i}$ is the leverage of sample $i$, and

$$\tilde{\sigma}^{2}=\frac{\|Y-X \hat{\beta}\|_{2}^{2}}{(n-p)} .$$

Prove that the joint distribution of $s=\left(s_{1}, \ldots, s_{n}\right)^{\top}$ is the same in the following two models: (i) $\varepsilon \sim N(0, \sigma I)$, and (ii) $\varepsilon \mid \sigma \sim N(0, \sigma I)$, with $1 / \sigma \sim \chi_{\nu}^{2}$ (in this model, $\varepsilon_{1}, \ldots, \varepsilon_{n}$ are identically $t_{\nu}$-distributed). [Hint: A random vector $Z$ is spherically symmetric if for any orthogonal matrix $H, H Z \stackrel{d}{=} Z$. If $Z$ is spherically symmetric and a.s. nonzero, then $Z /\|Z\|_{2}$ is a uniform point on the sphere; in addition, any orthogonal projection of $Z$ is also spherically symmetric. A standard normal vector is spherically symmetric.]

(b) A social scientist regresses the income of 120 Cambridge graduates onto 20 answers from a questionnaire given to the participants in their first year. She notices one questionnaire with very unusual answers, which she suspects was due to miscoding. The sample has a leverage of $0.8$. To check whether this sample is an outlier, she computes its externally studentized residual,

$$t_{i}=\frac{Y_{i}-x_{i}^{\top} \hat{\beta}}{\tilde{\sigma}_{(i)} \sqrt{1-p_{i}}}=4.57,$$

where $\tilde{\sigma}_{(i)}$ is estimated from a fit of all samples except the one in question, $\left(x_{i}, Y_{i}\right)$. Is this a high leverage point? Can she conclude this sample is an outlier at a significance level of $5 \%$ ?

(c) After examining the following plot of residuals against the response, the investigator calculates the externally studentized residual of the participant denoted by the black dot, which is $2.33$. Can she conclude this sample is an outlier with a significance level of $5 \%$ ?
