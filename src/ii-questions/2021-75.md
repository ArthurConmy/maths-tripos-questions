(a) A flat $(k=0)$, isotropic and homogeneous universe has metric $g_{\alpha \beta}$ given by

$$d s^{2}=-d t^{2}+a^{2}(t)\left(d x^{2}+d y^{2}+d z^{2}\right)$$

(i) Show that the non-vanishing Christoffel symbols and Ricci tensor components are

$$\Gamma_{i i}^{0}=a \dot{a}, \quad \Gamma_{0 i}^{i}=\Gamma_{i 0}^{i}=\frac{\dot{a}}{a}, \quad R_{00}=-3 \frac{\ddot{a}}{a}, \quad R_{i i}=a \ddot{a}+2 \dot{a}^{2}$$

where dots are time derivatives and $i \in\{1,2,3\}$ (no summation assumed).

(ii) Derive the first-order Friedmann equation from the Einstein equations, $G_{\alpha \beta}+\Lambda g_{\alpha \beta}=8 \pi T_{\alpha \beta} .$

(b) Consider a flat universe described by ( $\dagger$ ) with $\Lambda=0$ in which late-time acceleration is driven by "phantom" dark energy obeying an equation of state with pressure $P_{\mathrm{ph}}=w \rho_{\mathrm{ph}}$, where $w<-1$ and the energy density $\rho_{\mathrm{ph}}>0$. The remaining matter is dust, so we have $\rho=\rho_{\mathrm{ph}}+\rho_{\mathrm{dust}}$ with each component separately obeying $\dot{\rho}=-3 \frac{\dot{a}}{a}(\rho+P)$.

(i) Calculate an approximate solution for the scale factor $a(t)$ that is valid at late times. Show that the asymptotic behaviour is given by a Big Rip, that is, a singularity in which $a \rightarrow \infty$ at some finite time $t^{*}$.

(ii) Sketch a diagram of the scale factor $a$ as a function of $t$ for a convenient choice of $w$, ensuring that it includes (1) the Big Bang, (2) matter domination, (3) phantom-energy domination, and (4) the Big Rip. Label these epochs and mark them on the axes.

(iii) Most reasonable classical matter fields obey the null energy condition, which states that the energy-momentum tensor everywhere satisfies $T_{\alpha \beta} V^{\alpha} V^{\beta} \geqslant 0$ for any null vector $V^{\alpha}$. Determine if this applies to phantom energy.

[The energy-momentum tensor for a perfect fluid is $\left.T_{\alpha \beta}=(\rho+P) u_{\alpha} u_{\beta}+P g_{\alpha \beta}\right]$
