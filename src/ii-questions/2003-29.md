(i) Explain briefly what is meant by the concepts of hydrostatic equilibrium and the buoyancy frequency. Evaluate an expression for the buoyancy frequency in an incompressible inviscid fluid with stable density profile $\rho(z)$.

(ii) Explain briefly what is meant by the Boussinesq approximation.

Write down the equations describing motions of small amplitude in an incompressible, stratified, Boussinesq fluid of constant buoyancy frequency.

Derive the resulting dispersion relationship for plane wave motion. Show that there is a maximum frequency for the waves and explain briefly why this is the case.

What would be the response to a solid body oscillating at a frequency in excess of the maximum?
