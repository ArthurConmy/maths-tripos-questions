Let $G$ be the group with 21 elements generated by $a$ and $b$, subject to the relations $a^{7}=b^{3}=1$ and $b a=a^{2} b .$

(i) Find the conjugacy classes of $G$.

(ii) Find three non-isomorphic one-dimensional representations of $G$.

(iii) For a subgroup $H$ of a finite group $K$, write down (without proof) the formula for the character of the $K$-representation induced from a representation of $H$.

(iv) By applying Part (iii) to the case when $H$ is the subgroup $\langle a\rangle$ of $K=G$, find the remaining irreducible characters of $G$.
