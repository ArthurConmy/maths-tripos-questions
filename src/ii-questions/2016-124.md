Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of the finite group $G$. Explain how a (complex) representation of $G / N$ gives rise to an associated representation of $G$, and briefly describe which representations of $G$ arise this way.

Let $G$ be the group of order 54 which is given by

$$G=\left\langle a, b: a^{9}=b^{6}=1, b^{-1} a b=a^{2}\right\rangle$$

Find the conjugacy classes of $G$. By observing that $N_{1}=\langle a\rangle$ and $N_{2}=\left\langle a^{3}, b^{2}\right\rangle$ are normal in $G$, or otherwise, construct the character table of $G$.
