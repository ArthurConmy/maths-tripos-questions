Briefly describe the methods of Shannon-Fano and Huffman for economical coding. Illustrate both methods by finding decipherable binary codings in the case where messages $\mu_{1}, \ldots, \mu_{5}$ are emitted with probabilities $0.45,0.25,0.2,0.05,0.05$. Compute the expected word length in each case.
