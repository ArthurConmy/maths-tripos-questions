Consider the system

$$\begin{aligned}
&\dot{x}=y+x y \\
&\dot{y}=x-\frac{3}{2} y+x^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Show that the origin is a hyperbolic fixed point and find the stable and unstable invariant subspaces of the linearised system.

Calculate the stable and unstable manifolds correct to quadratic order, expressing $y$ as a function of $x$ for each.
