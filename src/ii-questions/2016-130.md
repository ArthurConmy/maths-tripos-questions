The $R$ command

$>\operatorname{boxcox}($ rainfall $\sim$ month+elnino+month:elnino)

performs a Box-Cox transform of the response at several values of the parameter $\lambda$, and produces the following plot:

We fit two linear models and obtain the Q-Q plots for each fit, which are shown below in no particular order:

Define the variable on the $y$-axis in the output of boxcox, and match each Q-Q plot to one of the models.

After choosing the model fit.2, the researcher calculates Cook's distance for the $i$ th sample, which has high leverage, and compares it to the upper $0.01$-point of an $F_{p, n-p}$ distribution, because the design matrix is of size $n \times p$. Provide an interpretation of this comparison in terms of confidence sets for $\hat{\beta}$. Is this confidence statement exact?
