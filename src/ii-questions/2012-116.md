Discuss the consequences of indistinguishability for a quantum mechanical state consisting of two identical, non-interacting particles when the particles have (a) spin zero, (b) spin 1/2.

The stationary Schr√∂dinger equation for one particle in the potential

$$\frac{-2 e^{2}}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} r}$$

has normalised, spherically-symmetric real wavefunctions $\psi_{n}(\mathbf{r})$ and energy eigenvalues $E_{n}$ with $E_{0}<E_{1}<E_{2}<\cdots$. The helium atom can be modelled by considering two non-interacting spin 1/2 particles in the above potential. What are the consequences of the Pauli exclusion principle for the ground state? Write down the two-electron state for this model in the form of a spatial wavefunction times a spin state. Assuming that wavefunctions are spherically-symmetric, find the states of the first excited energy level of the helium atom. What combined angular momentum quantum numbers $J, M$ does each state have?

Assuming standard perturbation theory results, arrive at a multi-dimensional integral in terms of the one-particle wavefunctions for the first-order correction to the helium ground state energy, arising from the electron-electron interaction.
