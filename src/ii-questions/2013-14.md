(i) Define a Poisson process as a Markov chain on the non-negative integers and state three other characterisations.

(ii) Let $\lambda(s)(s \geqslant 0)$ be a continuous positive function. Let $\left(X_{t}, t \geqslant 0\right)$ be a right-continuous process with independent increments, such that

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{P}\left(X_{t+h}=X_{t}+1\right) &=\lambda(t) h+o(h) \\
\mathbb{P}\left(X_{t+h}=X_{t}\right) &=1-\lambda(t) h+o(h)
\end{aligned}$$

where the $o(h)$ terms are uniform in $t \in[0, \infty)$. Show that $X_{t}$ is a Poisson random variable with parameter $\Lambda(t)=\int_{0}^{t} \lambda(s) d s$.

(iii) Let $X=\left(X_{n}: n=1,2, \ldots\right)$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed positive random variables with continuous density function $f$. We define the sequence of successive records, $\left(K_{n}, n=0,1, \ldots\right)$, by $K_{0}:=0$ and, for $n \geqslant 0$,

$$K_{n+1}:=\inf \left\{m>K_{n}: X_{m}>X_{K_{n}}\right\}$$

The record process,$\left(R_{t}, t \geqslant 0\right)$, is then defined by

$$R_{t}:=\#\left\{n \geqslant 1: X_{K_{n}} \leqslant t\right\}$$

Explain why the increments of $R$ are independent. Show that $R_{t}$ is a Poisson random variable with parameter $-\log \{1-F(t)\}$ where $F(t)=\int_{0}^{t} f(s) d s$.

[You may assume the following without proof: For fixed $t>0$, let $Y$ (respectively, $Z$ ) be the subsequence of $X$ obtained by retaining only those elements that are greater than (respectively, smaller than) $t$. Then $Y$ (respectively, $Z$ ) is a sequence of independent variables each having the distribution of $X_{1}$ conditioned on $X_{1}>t$ (respectively, $X_{1}<t$ ); and $Y$ and $Z$ are independent.]
