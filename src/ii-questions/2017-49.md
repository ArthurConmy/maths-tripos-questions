Define what it means for a subset $X \subset \mathbb{R}^{N}$ to be a manifold.

For manifolds $X$ and $Y$, state what it means for a map $f: X \rightarrow Y$ to be smooth. For such a smooth map, and $x \in X$, define the differential map $d f_{x}$.

What does it mean for $y \in Y$ to be a regular value of $f$ ? Give an example of a map $f: X \rightarrow Y$ and a $y \in Y$ which is not a regular value of $f$.

Show that the set $S L_{n}(\mathbb{R})$ of $n \times n$ real-valued matrices with determinant 1 can naturally be viewed as a manifold $S L_{n}(\mathbb{R}) \subset \mathbb{R}^{n^{2}}$. What is its dimension? Show that matrix multiplication $f: S L_{n}(\mathbb{R}) \times S L_{n}(\mathbb{R}) \rightarrow S L_{n}(\mathbb{R})$, defined by $f(A, B)=A B$, is smooth. [Standard theorems may be used without proof if carefully stated.] Describe the tangent space of $S L_{n}(\mathbb{R})$ at the identity $I \in S L_{n}(\mathbb{R})$ as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{n^{2}}$.

Show that if $n \geqslant 2$ then the set of real-valued matrices with determinant 0 , viewed as a subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n^{2}}$, is not a manifold.
