Describe in words the unicity distance of a cryptosystem.

Denote the cryptosystem by $\langle M, K, C\rangle$, in the usual way, and let $m \in M$ and $k \in K$ be random variables and $c=e(m, k)$. The unicity distance $U$ is formally defined to be the least $n>0$ such that $H\left(k \mid c^{(n)}\right)=0$. Derive the formula

$$U=\frac{\log |K|}{\log |\Sigma|-H}$$

where $H=H(m)$, and $\Sigma$ is the alphabet of the ciphertext. Make clear any assumptions you make.

The redundancy of a language is given by $R=1-\frac{H}{\log |\Sigma|}$. If a language has zero redundancy what is the unicity of any cryptosystem?
