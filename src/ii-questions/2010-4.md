State the path lifting and homotopy lifting lemmas for covering maps. Suppose that $X$ is path connected and locally path connected, that $p_{1}: Y_{1} \rightarrow X$ and $p_{2}: Y_{2} \rightarrow X$ are covering maps, and that $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ are simply connected. Using the lemmas you have stated, but without assuming the correspondence between covering spaces and subgroups of $\pi_{1}$, prove that $Y_{1}$ is homeomorphic to $Y_{2}$.
