Let $\left(X_{t}, t \geqslant 0\right)$ be an irreducible continuous-time Markov chain with initial probability distribution $\pi$ and Q-matrix $Q$ (for short: a $(\pi, Q)$ CTMC), on a finite state space $I$.

(i) Define the terms reversible CTMC and detailed balance equations (DBEs) and explain, without proof, the relation between them.

(ii) Prove that any solution of the DBEs is an equilibrium distribution (ED) for $\left(X_{t}\right)$.

Let $\left(Y_{n}, n=0,1, \ldots\right)$ be an irreducible discrete-time Markov chain with initial probability distribution $\widehat{\pi}$ and transition probability matrix $\widehat{P}$ (for short: a $(\widehat{\pi}, \widehat{P})$ DTMC), on the state space $I$.

(iii) Repeat the two definitions from (i) in the context of the DTMC $\left(Y_{n}\right)$. State also in this context the relation between them, and prove a statement analogous to (ii).

(iv) What does it mean to say that $\left(Y_{n}\right)$ is the jump chain for $\left(X_{t}\right)$ ? State and prove a relation between the ED $\pi$ for the $\operatorname{CTMC}\left(X_{t}\right)$ and the ED $\widehat{\pi}$ for its jump chain $\left(Y_{n}\right)$.

(v) Prove that $\left(X_{t}\right)$ is reversible (in equilibrium) if and only if its jump chain $\left(Y_{n}\right)$ is reversible (in equilibrium).

(vi) Consider now a continuous time random walk on a graph. More precisely, consider a CTMC $\left(X_{t}\right)$ on an undirected graph, where some pairs of states $i, j \in I$ are joined by one or more non-oriented 'links' $e_{i j}(1), \ldots, e_{i j}\left(m_{i j}\right)$. Here $m_{i j}=m_{j i}$ is the number of links between $i$ and $j$. Assume that the jump rate $q_{i j}$ is proportional to $m_{i j}$. Can the chain $\left(X_{t}\right)$ be reversible? Identify the corresponding jump chain $\left(Y_{n}\right)$ (which determines a discrete-time random walk on the graph) and comment on its reversibility.
