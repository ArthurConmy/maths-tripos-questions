The Lagrangian of a particle of mass $m$ and charge $q$ moving in an electromagnetic field described by scalar and vector potentials $\phi(\mathbf{r}, t)$ and $\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r}, t)$ is

$$L=\frac{1}{2} m|\dot{\mathbf{r}}|^{2}+q(-\phi+\dot{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{A})$$

where $\mathbf{r}(t)$ is the position vector of the particle and $\dot{\mathbf{r}}=d \mathbf{r} / d t$.

(a) Show that Lagrange's equations are equivalent to the equation of motion

$$m \ddot{\mathbf{r}}=q(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}),$$

where

$$\mathbf{E}=-\nabla \phi-\frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial t}, \quad \mathbf{B}=\nabla \times \mathbf{A}$$

are the electric and magnetic fields.

(b) Show that the related Hamiltonian is

$$H=\frac{|\mathbf{p}-q \mathbf{A}|^{2}}{2 m}+q \phi,$$

where $\mathbf{p}=m \dot{\mathbf{r}}+q \mathbf{A}$. Obtain Hamilton's equations for this system.

(c) Verify that the electric and magnetic fields remain unchanged if the scalar and vector potentials are transformed according to

where $f(\mathbf{r}, t)$ is a scalar field. Show that the transformed Lagrangian $\tilde{L}$ differs from $L$ by the total time-derivative of a certain quantity. Why does this leave the form of Lagrange's equations invariant? Show that the transformed Hamiltonian $\tilde{H}$ and phase-space variables $(\mathbf{r}, \tilde{\mathbf{p}})$ are related to $H$ and $(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{p})$ by a canonical transformation.

[Hint: In standard notation, the canonical transformation associated with the type-2 generating function $F_{2}(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{P}, t)$ is given by

$$\left.\mathbf{p}=\frac{\partial F_{2}}{\partial \mathbf{q}}, \quad \mathbf{Q}=\frac{\partial F_{2}}{\partial \mathbf{P}}, \quad K=H+\frac{\partial F_{2}}{\partial t} .\right]$$

$$\begin{aligned}
& \phi \mapsto \tilde{\phi}=\phi-\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}, \\
& \mathbf{A} \mapsto \tilde{\mathbf{A}}=\mathbf{A}+\nabla f, 
\end{aligned}$$
