(a) Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve, and let $D$ be an effective divisor on $C$. Explain how $D$ defines a morphism $\phi_{D}$ from $C$ to some projective space.

State a necessary and sufficient condition on $D$ so that the pull-back of a hyperplane via $\phi_{D}$ is an element of the linear system $|D|$.

State necessary and sufficient conditions for $\phi_{D}$ to be an isomorphism onto its image.

(b) Let $C$ now have genus 2 , and let $K$ be an effective canonical divisor. Show that the morphism $\phi_{K}$ is a morphism of degree 2 from $C$ to $\mathbb{P}^{1}$.

Consider the divisor $K+P_{1}+P_{2}$ for points $P_{i}$ with $P_{1}+P_{2} \nsim K$. Show that the linear system associated to this divisor induces a morphism $\phi$ from $C$ to a quartic curve in $\mathbb{P}^{2}$. Show furthermore that $\phi(P)=\phi(Q)$, with $P \neq Q$, if and only if $\{P, Q\}=\left\{P_{1}, P_{2}\right\}$.
