(a) What is meant by the canonical ensemble? Consider a system in the canonical ensemble that can be in states $|n\rangle, n=0,1,2, \ldots$ with energies $E_{n}$. Write down the partition function for this system and the probability $p(n)$ that the system is in state $|n\rangle$. Derive an expression for the average energy $\langle E\rangle$ in terms of the partition function.

(b) Consider an anharmonic oscillator with energy levels

$$\hbar \omega\left[\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)+\delta\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}\right], \quad n=0,1,2, \ldots$$

where $\omega$ is a positive constant and $0<\delta \ll 1$ is a small constant. Let the oscillator be in contact with a reservoir at temperature $T$. Show that, to linear order in $\delta$, the partition function $Z_{1}$ for the oscillator is given by

$$Z_{1}=\frac{c_{1}}{\sinh \frac{x}{2}}\left[1+\delta c_{2} x\left(1+\frac{2}{\sinh ^{2} \frac{x}{2}}\right)\right], \quad x=\frac{\hbar \omega}{k_{B} T}$$

where $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ are constants to be determined. Also show that, to linear order in $\delta$, the average energy of a system of $N$ uncoupled oscillators of this type is given by

$$\langle E\rangle=\frac{N \hbar \omega}{2}\left\{c_{3} \operatorname{coth} \frac{x}{2}+\delta\left[c_{4}+\frac{c_{5}}{\sinh ^{2} \frac{x}{2}}\left(1-x \operatorname{coth} \frac{x}{2}\right)\right]\right\}$$

where $c_{3}, c_{4}, c_{5}$ are constants to be determined.
