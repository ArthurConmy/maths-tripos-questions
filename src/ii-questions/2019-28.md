(a) The angular momentum of a rigid body about its centre of mass is conserved.

Derive Euler's equations,

$$\begin{aligned}
&I_{1} \dot{\omega}_{1}=\left(I_{2}-I_{3}\right) \omega_{2} \omega_{3} \\
&I_{2} \dot{\omega}_{2}=\left(I_{3}-I_{1}\right) \omega_{3} \omega_{1} \\
&I_{3} \dot{\omega}_{3}=\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\right) \omega_{1} \omega_{2}
\end{aligned}$$

explaining the meaning of the quantities appearing in the equations.

(b) Show that there are two independent conserved quantities that are quadratic functions of $\boldsymbol{\omega}=\left(\omega_{1}, \omega_{2}, \omega_{3}\right)$, and give a physical interpretation of them.

(c) Derive a linear approximation to Euler's equations that applies when $\left|\omega_{1}\right| \ll\left|\omega_{3}\right|$ and $\left|\omega_{2}\right| \ll\left|\omega_{3}\right|$. Use this to determine the stability of rotation about each of the three principal axes of an asymmetric top.
