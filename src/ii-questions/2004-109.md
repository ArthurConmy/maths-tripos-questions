For each of the following curves $C$

(i) $C=\left\{(x, y) \in \mathbb{A}^{2} \mid x^{3}-x=y^{2}\right\} \quad$ (ii) $C=\left\{(x, y) \in \mathbb{A}^{2} \mid x^{2} y+x y^{2}=x^{4}+y^{4}\right\}$

compute the points at infinity of $\bar{C} \subset \mathbb{P}^{2}$ (i.e. describe $\bar{C} \backslash C$ ), and find the singular points of the projective curve $\bar{C}$.

At which points of $\bar{C}$ is the rational map $\bar{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^{1}$, given by $(X: Y: Z) \mapsto(X: Y)$, not defined? Justify your answer.
