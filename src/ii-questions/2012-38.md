For a surface $S \subset \mathbb{R}^{3}$, define what is meant by the exponential mapping exp $p$ at $p \in S$, geodesic polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$ and geodesic circles.

Let $E, F, G$ be the coefficients of the first fundamental form in geodesic polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$. Prove that $\lim _{r \rightarrow 0} \sqrt{G}(r, \theta)=0$ and $\lim _{r \rightarrow 0}(\sqrt{G})_{r}(r, \theta)=1$. Give an expression for the Gaussian curvature $K$ in terms of $G$.

Prove that the Gaussian curvature at a point $p \in S$ satisfies

$$K(p)=\lim _{r \rightarrow 0} \frac{12\left(\pi r^{2}-A_{p}(r)\right)}{\pi r^{4}}$$

where $A_{p}(r)$ is the area of the region bounded by the geodesic circle of radius $r$ centred at $p$.

[You may assume that $E=1, F=0$ and $d\left(\exp _{p}\right)_{0}$ is an isometry. Taylor's theorem with any form of the remainder may be assumed if accurately stated.]
