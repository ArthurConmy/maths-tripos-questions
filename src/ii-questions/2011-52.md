If $A_{i}\left(x_{j}\right)$ is harmonic, i.e. if $\nabla^{2} A_{i}=0$, show that

$$u_{i}=A_{i}-x_{k} \frac{\partial A_{k}}{\partial x_{i}}, \quad \text { with } \quad p=-2 \mu \frac{\partial A_{n}}{\partial x_{n}},$$

satisfies the incompressibility condition and the Stokes equation. Show that the stress tensor is

$$\sigma_{i j}=2 \mu\left(\delta_{i j} \frac{\partial A_{n}}{\partial x_{n}}-x_{k} \frac{\partial^{2} A_{k}}{\partial x_{i} \partial x_{j}}\right)$$

Consider the Stokes flow corresponding to

$$A_{i}=V_{i}\left(1-\frac{a}{2 r}\right),$$

where $V_{i}$ are the components of a constant vector $\mathbf{V}$. Show that on the sphere $r=a$ the normal component of velocity vanishes and the surface traction $\sigma_{i j} x_{j} / a$ is in the normal direction. Hence deduce that the drag force on the sphere is given by

$$\mathbf{F}=4 \pi \mu a \mathbf{V}$$
