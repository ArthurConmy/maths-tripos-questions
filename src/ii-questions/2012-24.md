Consider a rigid body with principal moments of inertia $I_{1}, I_{2}, I_{3}$.

(a) Derive Euler's equations of torque-free motion

$$\begin{aligned}
&I_{1} \dot{\omega}_{1}=\left(I_{2}-I_{3}\right) \omega_{2} \omega_{3}, \\
&I_{2} \dot{\omega}_{2}=\left(I_{3}-I_{1}\right) \omega_{3} \omega_{1} \\
&I_{3} \dot{\omega}_{3}=\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\right) \omega_{1} \omega_{2}
\end{aligned}$$

with components of the angular velocity $\boldsymbol{\omega}=\left(\omega_{1}, \omega_{2}, \omega_{3}\right)$ given in the body frame.

(b) Show that rotation about the second principal axis is unstable if $\left(I_{2}-I_{3}\right)\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\right)>0$.

(c) The principal moments of inertia of a uniform cylinder of radius $R$, height $h$ and mass $M$ about its centre of mass are

$$I_{1}=I_{2}=\frac{M R^{2}}{4}+\frac{M h^{2}}{12} \quad ; \quad I_{3}=\frac{M R^{2}}{2} .$$

The cylinder has two identical cylindrical holes of radius $r$ drilled along its length. The axes of symmetry of the holes are at a distance $a$ from the axis of symmetry of the cylinder such that $r<R / 2$ and $r<a<R-r$. All three axes lie in a single plane. Compute the principal moments of inertia of the body.
