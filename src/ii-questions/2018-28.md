Derive Hamilton's equations from an action principle.

Consider a two-dimensional phase space with the Hamiltonian $H=p^{2}+q^{-2}$. Show that $F=p q-c t H$ is the first integral for some constant $c$ which should be determined. By considering the surfaces of constant $F$ in the extended phase space, solve Hamilton's equations, and sketch the orbits in the phase space.
