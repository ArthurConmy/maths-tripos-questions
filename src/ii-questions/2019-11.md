(a) A classical beam of particles scatters off a spherically symmetric potential $V(r)$. Draw a diagram to illustrate the differential cross-section $d \sigma / d \Omega$, and use this to derive an expression for $d \sigma / d \Omega$ in terms of the impact parameter $b$ and the scattering angle $\theta$.

A quantum beam of particles of mass $m$ and momentum $p=\hbar k$ is incident along the $z$-axis and scatters off a spherically symmetric potential $V(r)$. Write down the asymptotic form of the wavefunction $\psi$ in terms of the scattering amplitude $f(\theta)$. By considering the probability current $\mathbf{J}=-i(\hbar / 2 m)\left(\psi^{\star} \nabla \psi-\left(\nabla \psi^{\star}\right) \psi\right)$, derive an expression for the differential cross-section $d \sigma / d \Omega$ in terms of $f(\theta)$.

(b) The solution $\psi(\mathbf{r})$ of the radial Schrödinger equation for a particle of mass $m$ and wave number $k$ moving in a spherically symmetric potential $V(r)$ has the asymptotic form

$$\psi(\mathbf{r}) \sim \sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\left[A_{l}(k) \frac{\sin \left(k r-\frac{l \pi}{2}\right)}{k r}-B_{l}(k) \frac{\cos \left(k r-\frac{l \pi}{2}\right)}{k r}\right] P_{l}(\cos \theta)$$

valid for $k r \gg 1$, where $A_{l}(k)$ and $B_{l}(k)$ are constants and $P_{l}$ denotes the $l$ th Legendre polynomial. Define the S-matrix element $S_{l}$ and the corresponding phase shift $\delta_{l}$ for the partial wave of angular momentum $l$, in terms of $A_{l}(k)$ and $B_{l}(k)$. Define also the scattering length $a_{s}$ for the potential $V$.

Outside some core region, $r>r_{0}$, the Schrödinger equation for some such potential is solved by the s-wave (i.e. $l=0$ ) wavefunction $\psi(\mathbf{r})=\psi(r)$ with,

$$\psi(r)=\frac{e^{-i k r}}{r}+\frac{k+i \lambda \tanh (\lambda r)}{k-i \lambda} \frac{e^{i k r}}{r}$$

where $\lambda>0$ is a constant. Extract the S-matrix element $S_{0}$, the phase shift $\delta_{0}$ and the scattering length $a_{s}$. Deduce that the potential $V(r)$ has a bound state of zero angular momentum and compute its energy. Give the form of the (un-normalised) bound state wavefunction in the region $r>r_{0}$.
