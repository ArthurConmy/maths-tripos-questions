State the Implicit Function Theorem and outline how it produces submanifolds of Euclidean spaces.

Show that the unitary group $U(n) \subset G L(n, \mathbb{C})$ is a smooth manifold and find its dimension.

Identify the tangent space to $U(n)$ at the identity matrix as a subspace of the space of $n \times n$ complex matrices.
