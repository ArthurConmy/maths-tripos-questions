A cylindrical pipe of radius $a$ and length $L \gg a$ contains two viscous fluids arranged axisymmetrically with fluid 1 of viscosity $\mu_{1}$ occupying the central region $r<\beta a$, where $0<\beta<1$, and fluid 2 of viscosity $\mu_{2}$ occupying the surrounding annular region $\beta a<r<a$. The flow in each fluid is assumed to be steady and unidirectional, with velocities $u_{1}(r) \mathbf{e}_{z}$ and $u_{2}(r) \mathbf{e}_{z}$ respectively, with respect to cylindrical coordinates $(r, \theta, z)$ aligned with the pipe. A fixed pressure drop $\Delta p$ is applied between the ends of the pipe.

Starting from the Navier-Stokes equations, derive the equations satisfied by $u_{1}(r)$ and $u_{2}(r)$, and state all the boundary conditions. Show that the pressure gradient is constant.

Solve for the velocity profile in each fluid and calculate the corresponding flow rates, $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$.

Derive the relationship between $\beta$ and $\mu_{2} / \mu_{1}$ that yields the same flow rate in each fluid. Comment on the behaviour of $\beta$ in the limits $\mu_{2} / \mu_{1} \gg 1$ and $\mu_{2} / \mu_{1} \ll 1$, illustrating your comment by sketching the flow profiles.

$[$ Hint: In cylindrical coordinates $(r, \theta, z)$,

$$\nabla^{2} u=\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r \frac{\partial u}{\partial r}\right)+\frac{1}{r^{2}} \frac{\partial^{2} u}{\partial \theta^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2} u}{\partial z^{2}}, \quad e_{r z}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial u_{r}}{\partial z}+\frac{\partial u_{z}}{\partial r}\right)$$
