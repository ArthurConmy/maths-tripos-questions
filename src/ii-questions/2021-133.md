In this question we work over $\mathbb{C}$.

(a) (i) Let $H$ be a subgroup of a finite group $G$. Given an $H$-space $W$, define the complex vector space $V=\operatorname{Ind}_{H}^{G}(W)$. Define, with justification, the $G$-action on $V$.

(ii) Write $\mathcal{C}(g)$ for the conjugacy class of $g \in G$. Suppose that $H \cap \mathcal{C}(g)$ breaks up into $s$ conjugacy classes of $H$ with representatives $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{s}$. If $\psi$ is a character of $H$, write down, without proof, a formula for the induced character $\operatorname{Ind}_{H}^{G}(\psi)$ as a certain sum of character values $\psi\left(x_{i}\right)$.

(b) Define permutations $a, b \in S_{7}$ by $a=\left(\begin{array}{llllll}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6\end{array}\right), b=(235)(476)$ and let $G$ be the subgroup $\langle a, b\rangle$ of $S_{7}$. It is given that the elements of $G$ are all of the form $a^{i} b^{j}$ for $0 \leqslant i \leqslant 6,0 \leqslant j \leqslant 2$ and that $G$ has order 21 .

(i) Find the orders of the centralisers $C_{G}(a)$ and $C_{G}(b)$. Hence show that there are five conjugacy classes of $G$.

(ii) Find all characters of degree 1 of $G$ by lifting from a suitable quotient group.

(iii) Let $H=\langle a\rangle$. By first inducing linear characters of $H$ using the formula stated in part (a)(ii), find the remaining irreducible characters of $G$.
