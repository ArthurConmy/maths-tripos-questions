(a) Let $V$ be a real normed vector space. Show that any proper subspace of $V$ has empty interior.

Assuming $V$ to be infinite-dimensional and complete, prove that any algebraic basis of $V$ is uncountable. [The Baire category theorem can be used if stated properly.] Deduce that the vector space of polynomials with real coefficients cannot be equipped with a complete norm, i.e. a norm that makes it complete.

(b) Suppose that $\|\cdot\|_{1}$ and $\|\cdot\|_{2}$ are norms on a vector space $V$ such that $\left(V,\|\cdot\|_{1}\right)$ and $\left(V,\|\cdot\|_{2}\right)$ are both complete. Prove that if there exists $C_{1}>0$ such that $\|x\|_{2} \leqslant C_{1}\|x\|_{1}$ for all $x \in V$, then there exists $C_{2}>0$ such that $\|x\|_{1} \leqslant C_{2}\|x\|_{2}$ for all $x \in V$. Is this still true without the assumption that $\left(V,\|\cdot\|_{1}\right)$ and $\left(V,\|\cdot\|_{2}\right)$ are both complete? Justify your answer.

(c) Let $V$ be a real normed vector space (not necessarily complete) and $V^{*}$ be the set of linear continuous forms $f: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Let $\left(x_{n}\right)_{n \geqslant 1}$ be a sequence in $V$ such that $\sum_{n \geqslant 1}\left|f\left(x_{n}\right)\right|<\infty$ for all $f \in V^{*}$. Prove that

$$\sup _{\|f\|_{V^{*} \leqslant 1}} \sum_{n \geqslant 1}\left|f\left(x_{n}\right)\right|<\infty .$$
