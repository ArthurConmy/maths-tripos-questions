(a) Derive the solution of the one-dimensional wave equation

$$u_{t t}-u_{x x}=0, \quad u(0, x)=u_{0}(x), \quad u_{t}(0, x)=u_{1}(x),$$

with Cauchy data given by $C^{2}$ functions $u_{j}=u_{j}(x), j=0,1$, and where $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and $u_{t t}=\partial_{t}^{2} u$ etc. Explain what is meant by the property of finite propagation speed for the wave equation. Verify that the solution to (1) satisfies this property.

(b) Consider the Cauchy problem

$$u_{t t}-u_{x x}+x^{2} u=0, \quad u(0, x)=u_{0}(x), \quad u_{t}(0, x)=u_{1}(x)$$

By considering the quantities

$$e=\frac{1}{2}\left(u_{t}^{2}+u_{x}^{2}+x^{2} u^{2}\right) \quad \text { and } \quad p=-u_{t} u_{x}$$

prove that solutions of (2) also satisfy the property of finite propagation speed.

(c) Define what is meant by a strongly continuous one-parameter group of unitary operators on a Hilbert space. Consider the Cauchy problem for the Schr√∂dinger equation for $\psi(x, t) \in \mathbb{C}$ :

$$i \psi_{t}=-\psi_{x x}+x^{2} \psi, \quad \psi(x, 0)=\psi_{0}(x), \quad-\infty<x<\infty$$

[In the following you may use without proof the fact that there is an orthonormal set of (real-valued) Schwartz functions $\left\{f_{j}(x)\right\}_{j=1}^{\infty}$ which are eigenfunctions of the differential operator $P=-\partial_{x}^{2}+x^{2}$ with eigenvalues $2 j+1$, i.e.

$$P f_{j}=(2 j+1) f_{j}, \quad f_{j} \in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}), \quad\left(f_{j}, f_{k}\right)_{L^{2}}=\int_{\mathbb{R}} f_{j}(x) f_{k}(x) d x=\delta_{j k},$$

and which have the property that any function $u \in L^{2}$ can be written uniquely as a sum $u(x)=\sum_{j}\left(f_{j}, u\right)_{L^{2}} f_{j}(x)$ which converges in the metric defined by the $L^{2}$ norm.]

Write down the solution to (3) in the case that $\psi_{0}$ is given by a finite sum $\psi_{0}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}\left(f_{j}, \psi_{0}\right)_{L^{2}} f_{j}$ and show that your formula extends to define a strongly continuous one-parameter group of unitary operators on the Hilbert space $L^{2}$ of square-integrable (complex-valued) functions, with inner product $(f, g)_{L^{2}}=\int_{\mathbb{R}} \overline{f(x)} g(x) d x$.
