Show that the surface $S$ of revolution $x^{2}+y^{2}=\cosh ^{2} z$ in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is homeomorphic to a cylinder and has everywhere negative Gaussian curvature. Show moreover the existence of a closed geodesic on $S$.

Let $S \subset \mathbb{R}^{3}$ be an arbitrary embedded surface which is homeomorphic to a cylinder and has everywhere negative Gaussian curvature. By using a suitable version of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, show that $S$ contains at most one closed geodesic. [If required, appropriate forms of the Jordan curve theorem in the plane may also be used without proof.
