(a) Show that if $\mu(x, y)$ is an integrating factor for an equation of the form

$$f(x, y) d y+g(x, y) d x=0$$

then $\partial(\mu f) / \partial x=\partial(\mu g) / \partial y$.

Consider the equation

$$\cot x d y-\tan y d x=0$$

in the domain $0 \leqslant x \leqslant \frac{1}{2} \pi, \quad 0 \leqslant y \leqslant \frac{1}{2} \pi$. Using small line segments, sketch the flow directions in that domain. Show that $\sin x \cos y$ is an integrating factor for the equation. Find the general solution of the equation, and sketch the family of solutions that occupies the larger domain $-\frac{1}{2} \pi \leqslant x \leqslant \frac{1}{2} \pi,-\frac{1}{2} \pi \leqslant y \leqslant \frac{1}{2} \pi$.

(b) The following example illustrates that the concept of integrating factor extends to higher-order equations. Multiply the equation

$$\left[y \frac{d^{2} y}{d x^{2}}+\left(\frac{d y}{d x}\right)^{2}\right] \cos ^{2} x=1$$

by $\sec ^{2} x$, and show that the result takes the form $\frac{d}{d x} h(x, y)=0$, for some function $h(x, y)$ to be determined. Find a particular solution $y=y(x)$ such that $y(0)=0$ with $d y / d x$ finite at $x=0$, and sketch its graph in $0 \leqslant x<\frac{1}{2} \pi$.
