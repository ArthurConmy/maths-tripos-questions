Find the first three non-zero terms in the series solutions $y_{1}(x)$ and $y_{2}(x)$ for the differential equation

$$x^{2} y^{\prime \prime}-2 x y^{\prime}+\left(2-x^{2}\right) y=0$$

that satisfy

$$\begin{array}{llc}
y_{1}^{\prime}(0)=a & \text { and } & y_{1}^{\prime \prime}(0)=0 \\
y_{2}^{\prime}(0)=0 & \text { and } & y_{2}^{\prime \prime}(0)=2 b
\end{array}$$

Identify these solutions in closed form.
