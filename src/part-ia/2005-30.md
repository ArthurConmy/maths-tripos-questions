Find the unique positive integer $a$ with $a \leq 19$, for which

$$17 ! \cdot 3^{16} \equiv a(\bmod 19) \text {. }$$

Results used should be stated but need not be proved.

Solve the system of simultaneous congruences

$$\begin{aligned}
&x \equiv 1(\bmod 2), \\
&x \equiv 1(\bmod 3) \\
&x \equiv 3(\bmod 4) \\
&x \equiv 4(\bmod 5)
\end{aligned}$$

Explain very briefly your reasoning.
