A charge density $\rho=\lambda / r$ fills the region of 3-dimensional space $a<r<b$, where $r$ is the radial distance from the origin and $\lambda$ is a constant. Compute the electric field in all regions of space in terms of $Q$, the total charge of the region. Sketch a graph of the magnitude of the electric field versus $r$ (assuming that $Q>0$ ).

Now let $\Delta=b-a \rightarrow 0$. Derive the surface charge density $\sigma$ in terms of $\Delta, a$ and $\lambda$ and explain how a finite surface charge density may be obtained in this limit. Sketch the magnitude of the electric field versus $r$ in this limit. Comment on any discontinuities, checking a standard result involving $\sigma$ for this particular case.

A second shell of equal and opposite total charge is centred on the origin and has a radius $c<a$. Sketch the electric potential of this system, assuming that it tends to 0 as $r \rightarrow \infty$.
