Let $X$ be a metric space.

(a) What does it mean to say that a function $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is uniformly continuous? What does it mean to say that $f$ is Lipschitz? Show that if $f$ is Lipschitz then it is uniformly continuous. Show also that if $\left(x_{n}\right)_{n}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $X$, and $f$ is uniformly continuous, then the sequence $\left(f\left(x_{n}\right)\right)_{n}$ is convergent.

(b) Let $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be continuous, and $X$ be sequentially compact. Show that $f$ is uniformly continuous. Is $f$ necessarily Lipschitz? Justify your answer.

(c) Let $Y$ be a dense subset of $X$, and let $g: Y \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function. Show that there exists at most one continuous function $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $y \in Y$, $f(y)=g(y)$. Prove that if $g$ is uniformly continuous, then such a function $f$ exists, and is uniformly continuous.

[A subset $Y \subset X$ is dense if for any nonempty open subset $U \subset X$, the intersection $U \cap Y$ is nonempty.]
