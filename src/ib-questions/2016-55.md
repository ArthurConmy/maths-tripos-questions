Consider $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ with their usual topologies.

(a) Show that compact subsets of a Hausdorff topological space are closed. Show that compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are closed and bounded.

(b) Show that there exists a complete metric space $(X, d)$ admitting a surjective continuous map $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}$.
