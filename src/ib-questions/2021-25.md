Let $S \subset \mathbb{R}^{3}$ be an embedded smooth surface and $\gamma:[0,1] \rightarrow S$ a parameterised smooth curve on $S$. What is the energy of $\gamma$ ? By applying the Euler-Lagrange equations for stationary curves to the energy function, determine the differential equations for geodesics on $S$ explicitly in terms of a parameterisation of $S$.

If $S$ contains a straight line $\ell$, prove from first principles that each segment $[P, Q] \subset \ell$ (with some parameterisation) is a geodesic on $S$.

Let $H \subset \mathbb{R}^{3}$ be the hyperboloid defined by the equation $x^{2}+y^{2}-z^{2}=1$ and let $P=\left(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0}\right) \in H$. By considering appropriate isometries, or otherwise, display explicitly three distinct (as subsets of $H$ ) geodesics $\gamma: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow H$ through $P$ in the case when $z_{0} \neq 0$ and four distinct geodesics through $P$ in the case when $z_{0}=0$. Justify your answer.

Let $\gamma: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow H$ be a geodesic, with coordinates $\gamma(t)=(x(t), y(t), z(t))$. Clairaut's relation asserts $\rho(t) \sin \psi(t)$ is constant, where $\rho(t)=\sqrt{x(t)^{2}+y(t)^{2}}$ and $\psi(t)$ is the angle between $\dot{\gamma}(t)$ and the plane through the point $\gamma(t)$ and the $z$-axis. Deduce from Clairaut's relation that there exist infinitely many geodesics $\gamma(t)$ on $H$ which stay in the half-space $\{z>0\}$ for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$.

[You may assume that if $\gamma(t)$ satisfies the geodesic equations on $H$ then $\gamma$ is defined for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$ and the Euclidean norm $\|\dot{\gamma}(t)\|$ is constant. If you use a version of the geodesic equations for a surface of revolution, then that should be proved.]
