Consider two boxes, labelled $\mathrm{A}$ and B. Initially, there are no balls in box $\mathrm{A}$ and $k$ balls in box B. Each minute later, one of the $k$ balls is chosen uniformly at random and is moved to the opposite box. Let $X_{n}$ denote the number of balls in box A at time $n$, so that $X_{0}=0$.

(a) Find the transition probabilities of the Markov chain $\left(X_{n}\right)_{n \geqslant 0}$ and show that it is reversible in equilibrium.

(b) Find $\mathbb{E}(T)$, where $T=\inf \left\{n \geqslant 1: X_{n}=0\right\}$ is the next time that all $k$ balls are again in box $B$.
