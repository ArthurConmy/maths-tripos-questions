The electron in a hydrogen-like atom moves in a spherically symmetric potential $V(r)=-K / r$ where $K$ is a positive constant and $r$ is the radial coordinate of spherical polar coordinates. The two lowest energy spherically symmetric normalised states of the electron are given by

$$\chi_{1}(r)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi} a^{3 / 2}} e^{-r / a} \quad \text { and } \quad \chi_{2}(r)=\frac{1}{4 \sqrt{2 \pi} a^{3 / 2}}\left(2-\frac{r}{a}\right) e^{-r / 2 a}$$

where $a=\hbar^{2} / m K$ and $m$ is the mass of the electron. For any spherically symmetric function $f(r)$, the Laplacian is given by $\nabla^{2} f=\frac{d^{2} f}{d r^{2}}+\frac{2}{r} \frac{d f}{d r}$.

(i) Suppose that the electron is in the state $\chi(r)=\frac{1}{2} \chi_{1}(r)+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \chi_{2}(r)$ and its energy is measured. Find the expectation value of the result.

(ii) Suppose now that the electron is in state $\chi(r)$ (as above) at time $t=0$. Let $R(t)$ be the expectation value of a measurement of the electron's radial position $r$ at time $t$. Show that the value of $R(t)$ oscillates sinusoidally about a constant level and determine the frequency of the oscillation.
