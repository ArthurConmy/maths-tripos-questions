Starting from the Euler momentum equation, derive the form of Bernoulli's equation appropriate for an unsteady irrotational motion of an inviscid incompressible fluid.

Water of density $\rho$ is driven through a horizontal tube of length $L$ and internal radius $a$ from a water-filled balloon attached to one end of the tube. Assume that the pressure exerted by the balloon is proportional to its current volume (in excess of atmospheric pressure). Also assume that water exits the tube at atmospheric pressure, and that gravity may be neglected. Show that the time for the balloon to empty does not depend on its initial volume. Find the maximum speed of water exiting the pipe.
