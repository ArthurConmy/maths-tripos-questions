Consider a sequence of continuous functions $F_{n}:[-1,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Suppose that the functions $F_{n}$ converge uniformly to some continuous function $F$. Show that the integrals $\int_{-1}^{1} F_{n}(x) d x$ converge to $\int_{-1}^{1} F(x) d x$.

Give an example to show that, even if the functions $F_{n}(x)$ and $F(x)$ are differentiable, the derivatives $F_{n}^{\prime}(0)$ need not converge to $F^{\prime}(0)$.
