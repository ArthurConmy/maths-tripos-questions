A quantum-mechanical system has normalised energy eigenstates $\chi_{1}$ and $\chi_{2}$ with non-degenerate energies $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ respectively. The observable $A$ has normalised eigenstates,

$$\begin{aligned}
\phi_{1} &=C\left(\chi_{1}+2 \chi_{2}\right), & & \text { eigenvalue }=a_{1} \\
\phi_{2} &=C\left(2 \chi_{1}-\chi_{2}\right), & & \text { eigenvalue }=a_{2}
\end{aligned}$$

where $C$ is a positive real constant. Determine $C$.

Initially, at time $t=0$, the state of the system is $\phi_{1}$. Write down an expression for $\psi(t)$, the state of the system with $t \geqslant 0$. What is the probability that a measurement of energy at time $t$ will yield $E_{2}$ ?

For the same initial state, determine the probability that a measurement of $A$ at time $t>0$ will yield $a_{1}$ and the probability that it will yield $a_{2}$.
