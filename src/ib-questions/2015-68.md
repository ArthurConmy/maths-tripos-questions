Define the angular momentum operators $\hat{L}_{i}$ for a particle in three dimensions in terms of the position and momentum operators $\hat{x}_{i}$ and $\hat{p}_{i}=-i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{i}}$. Write down an expression for $\left[\hat{L}_{i}, \hat{L}_{j}\right]$ and use this to show that $\left[\hat{L}^{2}, \hat{L}_{i}\right]=0$ where $\hat{L}^{2}=\hat{L}_{x}^{2}+\hat{L}_{y}^{2}+\hat{L}_{z}^{2}$. What is the significance of these two commutation relations?

Let $\psi(x, y, z)$ be both an eigenstate of $\hat{L}_{z}$ with eigenvalue zero and an eigenstate of $\hat{L}^{2}$ with eigenvalue $\hbar^{2} l(l+1)$. Show that $\left(\hat{L}_{x}+i \hat{L}_{y}\right) \psi$ is also an eigenstate of both $\hat{L}_{z}$ and $\hat{L}^{2}$ and determine the corresponding eigenvalues.

Find real constants $A$ and $B$ such that

$$\phi(x, y, z)=\left(A z^{2}+B y^{2}-r^{2}\right) e^{-r}, \quad r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2},$$

is an eigenfunction of $\hat{L}_{z}$ with eigenvalue zero and an eigenfunction of $\hat{L}^{2}$ with an eigenvalue which you should determine. [Hint: You might like to show that $\left.\hat{L}_{i} f(r)=0 .\right]$
