Let $X$ be a metric space with the distance function $d: X \times X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. For a subset $Y$ of $X$, its diameter is defined as $\delta(Y):=\sup \left\{d\left(y, y^{\prime}\right) \mid y, y^{\prime} \in Y\right\}$.

Show that, if $X$ is compact and $\left\{U_{\lambda}\right\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ is an open covering of $X$, then there exists an $\epsilon>0$ such that every subset $Y \subset X$ with $\delta(Y)<\epsilon$ is contained in some $U_{\lambda}$. Paper 4, Section II

13G Metric and Topological Spaces

Let $X, Y$ be topological spaces and $X \times Y$ their product set. Let $p_{Y}: X \times Y \rightarrow Y$ be the projection map.

(i) Define the product topology on $X \times Y$. Prove that if a subset $Z \subset X \times Y$ is open then $p_{Y}(Z)$ is open in $Y$.

(ii) Give an example of $X, Y$ and a closed set $Z \subset X \times Y$ such that $p_{Y}(Z)$ is not closed.

(iii) When $X$ is compact, show that if a subset $Z \subset X \times Y$ is closed then $p_{Y}(Z)$ is closed
