State the Residue Theorem precisely.

Let $D$ be a star-domain, and let $\gamma$ be a closed path in $D$. Suppose that $f$ is a holomorphic function on $D$, having no zeros on $\gamma$. Let $N$ be the number of zeros of $f$ inside $\gamma$, counted with multiplicity (i.e. order of zero and winding number). Show that

$$N=\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{\gamma} \frac{f^{\prime}(z)}{f(z)} d z$$

[The Residue Theorem may be used without proof.]

Now suppose that $g$ is another holomorphic function on $D$, also having no zeros on $\gamma$ and with $|g(z)|<|f(z)|$ on $\gamma$. Explain why, for any $0 \leqslant t \leqslant 1$, the expression

$$I(t)=\int_{\gamma} \frac{f^{\prime}(z)+\operatorname{tg}^{\prime}(z)}{f(z)+\operatorname{tg}(z)} d z$$

is well-defined. By considering the behaviour of the function $I(t)$ as $t$ varies, deduce RouchÃ©'s Theorem.

For each $n$, let $p_{n}$ be the polynomial $\sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{z^{k}}{k !}$. Show that, as $n$ tends to infinity, the smallest modulus of the roots of $p_{n}$ also tends to infinity.

[You may assume any results on convergence of power series, provided that they are stated clearly.]
