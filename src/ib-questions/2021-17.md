A two-dimensional flow $\mathbf{u}=(u, v)$ has a velocity field given by

$$u=\frac{x^{2}-y^{2}}{\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)^{2}} \quad \text { and } \quad v=\frac{2 x y}{\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)^{2}}$$

(a) Show explicitly that this flow is incompressible and irrotational away from the origin.

(b) Find the stream function for this flow.

(c) Find the velocity potential for this flow.
