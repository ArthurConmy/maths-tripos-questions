A plane with unit normal $\mathbf{n}$ supports a charge density and a current density that are each time-independent. Show that the tangential components of the electric field and the normal component of the magnetic field are continuous across the plane.

Albert moves with constant velocity $\mathbf{v}=v \mathbf{n}$ relative to the plane. Find the boundary conditions at the plane on the normal component of the magnetic field and the tangential components of the electric field as seen in Albert's frame.
