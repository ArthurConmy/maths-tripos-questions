Suppose that six observations $X_{1}, \ldots, X_{6}$ are selected at random from a normal distribution for which both the mean $\mu_{X}$ and the variance $\sigma_{X}^{2}$ are unknown, and it is found that $S_{X X}=\sum_{i=1}^{6}\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)^{2}=30$, where $\bar{x}=\frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=1}^{6} x_{i}$. Suppose also that 21 observations $Y_{1}, \ldots, Y_{21}$ are selected at random from another normal distribution for which both the mean $\mu_{Y}$ and the variance $\sigma_{Y}^{2}$ are unknown, and it is found that $S_{Y Y}=40$. Derive carefully the likelihood ratio test of the hypothesis $H_{0}: \sigma_{X}^{2}=\sigma_{Y}^{2}$ against $H_{1}: \sigma_{X}^{2}>\sigma_{Y}^{2}$ and apply it to the data above at the $0.05$ level.
