Given $n+1$ distinct points $\left\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right\}$, let $p_{n} \in \mathbb{P}_{n}$ be the real polynomial of degree $n$ that interpolates a continuous function $f$ at these points. State the Lagrange interpolation formula.

Prove that $p_{n}$ can be written in the Newton form

$$p_{n}(x)=f\left(x_{0}\right)+\sum_{k=1}^{n} f\left[x_{0}, \ldots, x_{k}\right] \prod_{i=0}^{k-1}\left(x-x_{i}\right)$$

where $f\left[x_{0}, \ldots, x_{k}\right]$ is the divided difference, which you should define. [An explicit expression for the divided difference is not required.]

Explain why it can be more efficient to use the Newton form rather than the Lagrange formula. Paper 1, Section II

18D Numerical Analysis

Determine the real coefficients $b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}$ such that

$$\int_{-2}^{2} f(x) d x=b_{1} f(-1)+b_{2} f(0)+b_{3} f(1)$$

is exact when $f(x)$ is any real polynomial of degree 2 . Check explicitly that the quadrature is exact for $f(x)=x^{2}$ with these coefficients.

State the Peano kernel theorem and define the Peano kernel $K(\theta)$. Use this theorem to show that if $f \in C^{3}[-2,2]$, and $b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}$ are chosen as above, then

$$\left|\int_{-2}^{2} f(x) d x-b_{1} f(-1)-b_{2} f(0)-b_{3} f(1)\right| \leqslant \frac{4}{9} \max _{\xi \in[-2,2]}\left|f^{(3)}(\xi)\right|$$
