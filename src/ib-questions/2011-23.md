Water of constant density $\rho$ flows steadily through a long cylindrical tube, the wall of which is elastic. The exterior radius of the tube at a distance $z$ along the tube, $r(z)$, is determined by the pressure in the tube, $p(z)$, according to

$$r(z)=r_{0}+b\left(p(z)-p_{0}\right)$$

where $r_{0}$ and $p_{0}$ are the radius and pressure far upstream $(z \rightarrow-\infty)$, and $b$ is a positive constant.

The interior radius of the tube is $r(z)-h(z)$, where $h(z)$, the thickness of the wall, is a given slowly varying function of $z$ which is zero at both ends of the pipe. The velocity of the water in the pipe is $u(z)$ and the water enters the pipe at velocity $V$.

Show that $u(z)$ satisfies

$$H=1-v^{-\frac{1}{2}}+\frac{1}{4} k\left(1-v^{2}\right)$$

where $H=\frac{h}{r_{0}}, v=\frac{u}{V}$ and $k=\frac{2 b \rho V^{2}}{r_{0}}$. Sketch the graph of $H$ against $v$.

Let $H_{m}$ be the maximum value of $H$ in the tube. Show that the flow is only possible if $H_{m}$ does not exceed a certain critical value $H_{c}$. Find $H_{c}$ in terms of $k$.

Show that, under conditions to be determined (which include a condition on the value of $k)$, the water can leave the pipe with speed less than $V$.
