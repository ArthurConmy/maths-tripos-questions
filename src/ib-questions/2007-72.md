Consider the game with payoff matrix

$$\left(\begin{array}{lll}
2 & 5 & 4 \\
3 & 2 & 2 \\
2 & 1 & 3
\end{array}\right)$$

where the $(i, j)$ entry is the payoff to the row player if the row player chooses row $i$ and the column player chooses column $j$.

Find the value of the game and the optimal strategies for each player.
