Consider the two-person zero-sum game Rock, Scissors, Paper. That is, a player gets 1 point by playing Rock when the other player chooses Scissors, or by playing Scissors against Paper, or Paper against Rock; the losing player gets $-1$ point. Zero points are received if both players make the same move.

Suppose player one chooses Rock and Scissors (but never Paper) with probabilities $p$ and $1-p, 0 \leqslant p \leqslant 1$. Write down the maximization problem for player two's optimal strategy. Determine the optimal strategy for each value of $p$.
