A particle of mass $m$ and energy $E$, incident from $x=-\infty$, scatters off a delta function potential at $x=0$. The time independent Schr√∂dinger equation is

$$-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2 m} \frac{d^{2} \psi}{d x^{2}}+U \delta(x) \psi=E \psi$$

where $U$ is a positive constant. Find the reflection and transmission probabilities.
