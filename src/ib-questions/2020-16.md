State the structure theorem for a finitely generated module $M$ over a Euclidean domain $R$ in terms of invariant factors.

Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field $F$ and let $\alpha: V \rightarrow V$ be a linear map. Let $V_{\alpha}$ denote the $F[X]$-module $V$ with $X$ acting as $\alpha$. Apply the structure theorem to $V_{\alpha}$ to show the existence of a basis of $V$ with respect to which $\alpha$ has the rational canonical form. Prove that the minimal polynomial and the characteristic polynomial of $\alpha$ can be expressed in terms of the invariant factors. [Hint: For the characteristic polynomial apply suitable row operations.] Deduce the Cayley-Hamilton theorem for $\alpha$.

Now assume that $\alpha$ has matrix $\left(a_{i j}\right)$ with respect to the basis $v_{1}, \ldots, v_{n}$ of $V$. Let $M$ be the free $F[X]$-module of rank $n$ with free basis $m_{1}, \ldots, m_{n}$ and let $\theta: M \rightarrow V_{\alpha}$ be the unique homomorphism with $\theta\left(m_{i}\right)=v_{i}$ for $1 \leqslant i \leqslant n$. Using the fact, which you need not prove, that ker $\theta$ is generated by the elements $X m_{i}-\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{j i} m_{j}, 1 \leqslant i \leqslant n$, find the invariant factors of $V_{\alpha}$ in the case that $V=\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and $\alpha$ is represented by the real matrix

$$\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 1 & 0 \\
-4 & 4 & 0 \\
-2 & 1 & 2
\end{array}\right)$$

with respect to the standard basis.
