The efficacy of a new drug was tested as follows. Fifty patients were given the drug, and another fifty patients were given a placebo. A week later, the numbers of patients whose symptoms had gone entirely, improved, stayed the same and got worse were recorded, as summarised in the following table.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline & Drug & Placebo \\
\hline symptoms gone & 14 & 6 \\
improved & 21 & 19 \\
same & 10 & 10 \\
worse & 5 & 15 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Conduct a $5 \%$ significance level test of the null hypothesis that the medicine and placebo have the same effect, against the alternative that their effects differ.

\hline Distribution & $\chi_{1}^{2}$ & $\chi_{2}^{2}$ & $\chi_{3}^{2}$ & $\chi_{4}^{2}$ & $\chi_{6}^{2}$ & $\chi_{8}^{2}$ \\
\hline 95 th percentile & $3.84$ & $5.99$ & $7.81$ & $9.48$ & $12.59$ & $15.51$ \\
