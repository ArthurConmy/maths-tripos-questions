A two-dimensional flow is given by

$$\mathbf{u}=(x,-y+t)$$

Show that the flow is both irrotational and incompressible. Find a stream function $\psi(x, y)$ such that $\mathbf{u}=\left(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y},-\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}\right)$. Sketch the streamlines at $t=0$.

Find the pathline of a fluid particle that passes through $\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\right)$ at $t=0$ in the form $y=f\left(x, x_{0}, y_{0}\right)$ and sketch the pathline for $x_{0}=1, y_{0}=1 .$
