Determine the pressure at a depth $z$ below the surface of a static fluid of density $\rho$ subject to gravity $g$. A rigid body having volume $V$ is fully submerged in such a fluid. Calculate the buoyancy force on the body.

An iceberg of uniform density $\rho_{I}$ is observed to float with volume $V_{I}$ protruding above a large static expanse of seawater of density $\rho_{w}$. What is the total volume of the iceberg?
