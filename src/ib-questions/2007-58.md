Write down the Euler equation for the steady motion of an inviscid, incompressible fluid in a constant gravitational field. From this equation, derive (a) Bernoulli's equation and (b) the integral form of the momentum equation for a fixed control volume $V$ with surface $S$.

(i) A circular jet of water is projected vertically upwards with speed $U_{0}$ from a nozzle of cross-sectional area $A_{0}$ at height $z=0$. Calculate how the speed $U$ and crosssectional area $A$ of the jet vary with $z$, for $z \ll U_{0}^{2} / 2 g$.

(ii) A circular jet of speed $U$ and cross-sectional area $A$ impinges axisymmetrically on the vertex of a cone of semi-angle $\alpha$, spreading out to form an almost parallel-sided sheet on the surface. Choose a suitable control volume and, neglecting gravity, show that the force exerted by the jet on the cone is

$$\rho A U^{2}(1-\cos \alpha)$$

(iii) A cone of mass $M$ is supported, axisymmetrically and vertex down, by the jet of part (i), with its vertex at height $z=h$, where $h \ll U_{0}^{2} / 2 g$. Assuming that the result of part (ii) still holds, show that $h$ is given by

$$\rho A_{0} U_{0}^{2}\left(1-\frac{2 g h}{U_{0}^{2}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}(1-\cos \alpha)=M g$$
