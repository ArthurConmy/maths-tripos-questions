Suppose that $(X, d)$ is a metric space that has the Bolzano-Weierstrass property (that is, any sequence has a convergent subsequence). Let $\left(Y, d^{\prime}\right)$ be any metric space, and suppose that $f$ is a continuous map of $X$ onto $Y$. Show that $\left(Y, d^{\prime}\right)$ also has the Bolzano-Weierstrass property.

Show also that if $f$ is a bijection of $X$ onto $Y$, then $f^{-1}: Y \rightarrow X$ is continuous.

By considering the map $x \mapsto e^{i x}$ defined on the real interval $[-\pi / 2, \pi / 2]$, or otherwise, show that there exists a continuous choice of arg $z$ for the complex number $z$ lying in the right half-plane $\{x+i y: x>0\}$.
