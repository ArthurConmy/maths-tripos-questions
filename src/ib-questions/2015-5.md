Define what it means for a function $f: \mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{m}$ to be differentiable at $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ with derivative $D f(x)$.

State and prove the chain rule for the derivative of $g \circ f$, where $g: \mathbb{R}^{m} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{p}$ is a differentiable function.

Now let $f: \mathbb{R}^{2} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a differentiable function and let $g(x)=f(x, c-x)$ where $c$ is a constant. Show that $g$ is differentiable and find its derivative in terms of the partial derivatives of $f$. Show that if $D_{1} f(x, y)=D_{2} f(x, y)$ holds everywhere in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, then $f(x, y)=h(x+y)$ for some differentiable function $h .$
