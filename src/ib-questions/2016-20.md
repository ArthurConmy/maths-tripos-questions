A steady, two-dimensional unidirectional flow of a fluid with dynamic viscosity $\mu$ is set up between two plates at $y=0$ and $y=h$. The plate at $y=0$ is stationary while the plate at $y=h$ moves with constant speed $U \mathbf{e}_{x}$. The fluid is also subject to a constant pressure gradient $-G \mathbf{e}_{x}$. You may assume that the fluid velocity $\mathbf{u}$ has the form $\mathbf{u}=u(y) \mathbf{e}_{x}$.

(a) State the equation satisfied by $u(y)$ and its boundary conditions.

(b) Calculate $u(y)$.

(c) Show that the value of $U$ may be chosen to lead to zero viscous shear stress acting on the bottom plate and calculate the resulting flow rate.
