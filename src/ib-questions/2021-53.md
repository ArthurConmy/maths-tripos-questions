Explain what is meant by a two-person zero-sum game with $m \times n$ payoff matrix $A$, and define what is meant by an optimal strategy for each player. What are the relationships between the optimal strategies and the value of the game?

Suppose now that

$$A=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
0 & 1 & 1 & -4 \\
-1 & 0 & 2 & 2 \\
-1 & -2 & 0 & 3 \\
4 & -2 & -3 & 0
\end{array}\right)$$

Show that if strategy $p=\left(p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}\right)^{T}$ is optimal for player I, it must also be optimal for player II. What is the value of the game in this case? Justify your answer.

Explain why we must have $(A p)_{i} \leqslant 0$ for all $i$. Hence or otherwise, find the optimal strategy $p$ and prove that it is unique.
