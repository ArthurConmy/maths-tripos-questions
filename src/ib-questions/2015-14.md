In a constant electric field $\mathbf{E}=(E, 0,0)$ a particle of rest mass $m$ and charge $q>0$ has position $\mathbf{x}$ and velocity $\dot{\mathbf{x}}$. At time $t=0$, the particle is at rest at the origin. Including relativistic effects, calculate $\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t)$.

Sketch a graph of $|\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t)|$ versus $t$, commenting on the $t \rightarrow \infty$ limit.

Calculate $|\mathbf{x}(t)|$ as an explicit function of $t$ and find the non-relativistic limit at small times $t$.
