The diagram shows a network of sewage treatment plants, shown as circles, connected by pipes. Some pipes (indicated by a line with an arrowhead at one end only) allow sewage to flow in one direction only, others (indicated by a line with an arrowhead at both ends) allow sewage to flow in either direction. The capacities of the pipes are shown. The system serves three towns, shown in the diagram as squares.

Each sewage treatment plant can treat a limited amount of sewage, indicated by the number in the circle, and this may not be exceeded for fear of environmental damage. Treated sewage is pumped into the sea, but at any treatment plant incoming untreated sewage may be immediately pumped to another plant for treatment there.

Find the maximum amount of sewage which can be handled by the system, and how this is assigned to each of the three towns.
