Use Maxwell's equations to obtain the equation of continuity

$$\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}+\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}=0$$

Show that, for a body made from material of uniform conductivity $\sigma$, the charge density at any fixed internal point decays exponentially in time. If the body is finite and isolated, explain how this result can be consistent with overall charge conservation.
