Sketch the region $A$ which is the intersection of the discs

$$D_{0}=\{z \in \mathbb{C}:|z|<1\} \quad \text { and } \quad D_{1}=\{z \in \mathbb{C}:|z-(1+i)|<1\} .$$

Find a conformal mapping that maps $A$ onto the right half-plane $H=\{z \in \mathbb{C}: \operatorname{Re} z>0\}$. Also find a conformal mapping that maps $A$ onto $D_{0}$.

[Hint: You may find it useful to consider maps of the form $w(z)=\frac{a z+b}{c z+d}$.]
