Prove that the kernel of a group homomorphism $f: G \rightarrow H$ is a normal subgroup of the group $G$.

Show that the dihedral group $D_{8}$ of order 8 has a non-normal subgroup of order 2. Conclude that, for a group $G$, a normal subgroup of a normal subgroup of $G$ is not necessarily a normal subgroup of $G$.
