In an inertial frame $S$ a photon of energy $E$ is observed to travel at an angle $\theta$ relative to the $x$-axis. The inertial frame $S^{\prime}$ moves relative to $S$ at velocity $v$ in the $x$ direction and the $x^{\prime}$-axis of $S^{\prime}$ is taken parallel to the $x$-axis of $S$. Observed in $S^{\prime}$, the photon has energy $E^{\prime}$ and travels at an angle $\theta^{\prime}$ relative to the $x^{\prime}$-axis. Show that

$$E^{\prime}=\frac{E(1-\beta \cos \theta)}{\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}}, \quad \cos \theta^{\prime}=\frac{\cos \theta-\beta}{1-\beta \cos \theta},$$

where $\beta=v / c$.
