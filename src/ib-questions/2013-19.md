An incompressible, inviscid fluid occupies the region beneath the free surface $y=\eta(x, t)$ and moves with a velocity field determined by the velocity potential $\phi(x, y, t) .$ Gravity acts in the $-y$ direction. You may assume Bernoulli's integral of the equation of motion:

$$\frac{p}{\rho}+\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{2}|\nabla \phi|^{2}+g y=F(t)$$

Give the kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions that must be satisfied by $\phi$ on $y=\eta(x, t)$.

In the absence of waves, the fluid has constant uniform velocity $U$ in the $x$ direction. Derive the linearised form of the boundary conditions for small amplitude waves.

Assume that the free surface and velocity potential are of the form:

$$\begin{aligned}
\eta &=a e^{i(k x-\omega t)} \\
\phi &=U x+i b e^{k y} e^{i(k x-\omega t)}
\end{aligned}$$

(where implicitly the real parts are taken). Show that

$$(\omega-k U)^{2}=g k$$
