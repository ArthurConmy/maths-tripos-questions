For ideals $I, J$ of a ring $R$, their product $I J$ is defined as the ideal of $R$ generated by the elements of the form $x y$ where $x \in I$ and $y \in J$.

(1) Prove that, if a prime ideal $P$ of $R$ contains $I J$, then $P$ contains either $I$ or $J$.

(2) Give an example of $R, I$ and $J$ such that the two ideals $I J$ and $I \cap J$ are different from each other.

(3) Prove that there is a natural bijection between the prime ideals of $R / I J$ and the prime ideals of $R /(I \cap J)$.
