Define the QR factorization of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ and explain how it can be used to solve the least squares problem of finding the $x^{*} \in \mathbf{R}^{n}$ which minimises $\|A x-b\|$ where $b \in \mathbf{R}^{m}, m>n$, and the norm is the Euclidean one.

Define a Householder (reflection) transformation $H$ and show that it is an orthogonal matrix.

Using a Householder reflection, solve the least squares problem for

$$A=\left(\begin{array}{rrr}
2 & 4 & 7 \\
0 & 3 & -1 \\
0 & 0 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & -2
\end{array}\right), \quad b=\left(\begin{array}{r}
9 \\
-7 \\
3 \\
1 \\
-1
\end{array}\right)$$

giving both $x^{*}$ and $\left\|A x^{*}-b\right\|$. Paper 1, Section I

8E Optimization

What is the maximal flow problem in a network?

Explain the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. Why must this algorithm terminate if the initial flow is set to zero and all arc capacities are rational numbers?
