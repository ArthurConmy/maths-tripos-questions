Suppose $p(z)$ is a polynomial of even degree, all of whose roots satisfy $|z|<R$. Explain why there is a holomorphic (i.e. analytic) function $h(z)$ defined on the region $R<|z|<\infty$ which satisfies $h(z)^{2}=p(z)$. We write $h(z)=\sqrt{p(z)}$

By expanding in a Laurent series or otherwise, evaluate

$$\int_{C} \sqrt{z^{4}-z} d z$$

where $C$ is the circle of radius 2 with the anticlockwise orientation. (Your answer will be well-defined up to a factor of $\pm 1$, depending on which square root you pick.) Paper 2, Section II

13D Complex Analysis or Complex Methods Let

$$I=\oint_{C} \frac{e^{i z^{2} / \pi}}{1+e^{-2 z}} d z$$

where $C$ is the rectangle with vertices at $\pm R$ and $\pm R+i \pi$, traversed anti-clockwise.

(i) Show that $I=\frac{\pi(1+i)}{\sqrt{2}}$.

(ii) Assuming that the contribution to $I$ from the vertical sides of the rectangle is negligible in the limit $R \rightarrow \infty$, show that

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{i x^{2} / \pi} d x=\frac{\pi(1+i)}{\sqrt{2}}$$

(iii) Justify briefly the assumption that the contribution to $I$ from the vertical sides of the rectangle is negligible in the limit $R \rightarrow \infty$.
