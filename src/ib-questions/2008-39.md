(a) Legendre's equation may be written in the form

$$\frac{d}{d x}\left(\left(1-x^{2}\right) \frac{d y}{d x}\right)+\lambda y=0$$

Show that there is a series solution for $y$ of the form

$$y=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_{k} x^{k},$$

where the $a_{k}$ satisfy the recurrence relation

$$\frac{a_{k+2}}{a_{k}}=-\frac{(\lambda-k(k+1))}{(k+1)(k+2)} .$$

Hence deduce that there are solutions for $y(x)=P_{n}(x)$ that are polynomials of degree $n$, provided that $\lambda=n(n+1)$. Given that $a_{0}$ is then chosen so that $P_{n}(1)=1$, find the explicit form for $P_{2}(x)$.

(b) Laplace's equation for $\Phi(r, \theta)$ in spherical polar coordinates $(r, \theta, \phi)$ may be written in the axisymmetric case as

$$\frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial r^{2}}+\frac{2}{r} \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial r}+\frac{1}{r^{2}} \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\left(1-x^{2}\right) \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x}\right)=0$$

where $x=\cos \theta$.

Write down without proof the general form of the solution obtained by the method of separation of variables. Use it to find the form of $\Phi$ exterior to the sphere $r=a$ that satisfies the boundary conditions, $\Phi(a, x)=1+x^{2}$, and $\lim _{r \rightarrow \infty} \Phi(r, x)=0$.
