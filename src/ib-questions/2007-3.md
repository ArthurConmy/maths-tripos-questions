Suppose that $P$ is the complex vector space of complex polynomials in one variable, $z$.

(i) Show that the form $\langle$, $\rangle$ defined by

$$\langle f, g\rangle=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{2 \pi} f\left(e^{i \theta}\right) \cdot \overline{g\left(e^{i \theta}\right)} d \theta$$

is a positive definite Hermitian form on $P$.

(ii) Find an orthonormal basis of $P$ for this form, in terms of the powers of $z$.

(iii) Generalize this construction to complex vector spaces of complex polynomials in any finite number of variables.
