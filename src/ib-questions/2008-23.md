Let $f: \mathbb{R}^{2} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a function, and $\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\right)$ a point of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Prove that if the partial derivatives of $f$ exist in some open disc around $\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\right)$ and are continuous at $\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\right)$, then $f$ is differentiable at $\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\right)$.

Now let $X$ denote the vector space of all $(n \times n)$ real matrices, and let $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be the function assigning to each matrix its determinant. Show that $f$ is differentiable at the identity matrix $I$, and that $\left.D f\right|_{I}$ is the linear map $H \mapsto \operatorname{tr} H$. Deduce that $f$ is differentiable at any invertible matrix $A$, and that $\left.D f\right|_{A}$ is the linear map $H \mapsto \operatorname{det} A \operatorname{tr}\left(A^{-1} H\right) .$

Show also that if $K$ is a matrix with $\|K\|<1$, then $(I+K)$ is invertible. Deduce that $f$ is twice differentiable at $I$, and find $\left.D^{2} f\right|_{I}$ as a bilinear map $X \times X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

[You may assume that the norm $\|-\|$ on $X$ is complete, and that it satisfies the inequality $\|A B\| \leqslant\|A\| \cdot\|B\|$ for any two matrices $A$ and $B .]$
