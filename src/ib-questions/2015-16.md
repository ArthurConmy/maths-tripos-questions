(i) Write down the Lorentz force law for $d \mathbf{p} / d t$ due to an electric field $\mathbf{E}$ and magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ acting on a particle of charge $q$ moving with velocity $\dot{\mathbf{x}}$.

(ii) Write down Maxwell's equations in terms of $c$ (the speed of light in a vacuum), in the absence of charges and currents.

(iii) Show that they can be manipulated into a wave equation for each component of $\mathbf{E}$.

(iv) Show that Maxwell's equations admit solutions of the form

$$\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}, t)=\operatorname{Re}\left(\mathbf{E}_{0} e^{i(\omega t-\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x})}\right)$$

where $\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{0}}$ and $\mathbf{k}$ are constant vectors and $\omega$ is a constant (all real). Derive a condition on $\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{0}}$ and relate $\omega$ and $\mathbf{k}$.

(v) Suppose that a perfect conductor occupies the region $z<0$ and that a plane wave with $\mathbf{k}=(0,0,-k), \mathbf{E}_{0}=\left(E_{0}, 0,0\right)$ is incident from the vacuum region $z>0$. Write down boundary conditions for the $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ fields. Show that they can be satisfied if a suitable reflected wave is present, and determine the total $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ fields in real form.

(vi) At time $t=\pi /(4 \omega)$, a particle of charge $q$ and mass $m$ is at $(0,0, \pi /(4 k))$ moving with velocity $(c / 2,0,0)$. You may assume that the particle is far enough away from the conductor so that we can ignore its effect upon the conductor and that $q E_{0}>0$. Give a unit vector for the direction of the Lorentz force on the particle at time $t=\pi /(4 \omega)$.

(vii) Ignoring relativistic effects, find the magnitude of the particle's rate of change of velocity in terms of $E_{0}, q$ and $m$ at time $t=\pi /(4 \omega)$. Why is this answer inaccurate?
