Given a network with a source $A$, a sink $B$, and capacities on directed arcs, define what is meant by a minimum cut.

The $m$ streets and $n$ intersections of a town are represented by sets of edges $E$ and vertices $V$ of a connected graph. A city planner wishes to make all streets one-way while ensuring it possible to drive away from each intersection along at least $k$ different streets.

Use a theorem about min-cut and max-flow to prove that the city planner can achieve his goal provided that the following is true:

$$d(U) \geqslant k|U| \text { for all } U \subseteq V,$$

where $|U|$ is the size of $U$ and $d(U)$ is the number edges with at least one end in $U$. How could the planner find street directions that achieve his goal?

[Hint: Consider a network having nodes $A, B$, nodes $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{m}$ for the streets and nodes $b_{1}, \ldots, b_{n}$ for the intersections. There are directed arcs from $A$ to each and from each $b_{i}$ to $B$. From each $a_{i}$ there are two further arcs, directed towards $b_{j}$ and $b_{j^{\prime}}$ that correspond to endpoints of street $i .]$ Paper 4, Section II

20H Optimization

Given real numbers $a$ and $b$, consider the problem $\mathrm{P}$ of minimizing

$$f(x)=a x_{11}+2 x_{12}+3 x_{13}+b x_{21}+4 x_{22}+x_{23}$$

subject to $x_{i j} \geqslant 0$ and

$$\begin{array}{r}
x_{11}+x_{12}+x_{13}=5 \\
x_{21}+x_{22}+x_{23}=5 \\
x_{11}+x_{21}=3 \\
x_{12}+x_{22}=3 \\
x_{13}+x_{23}=4
\end{array}$$

List all the basic feasible solutions, writing them as $2 \times 3$ matrices $\left(x_{i j}\right)$.

Let $f(x)=\sum_{i j} c_{i j} x_{i j}$. Suppose there exist $\lambda_{i}, \mu_{j}$ such that

$$\lambda_{i}+\mu_{j} \leqslant c_{i j} \text { for all } i \in\{1,2\}, j \in\{1,2,3\}$$

Prove that if $x$ and $x^{\prime}$ are both feasible for $\mathrm{P}$ and $\lambda_{i}+\mu_{j}=c_{i j}$ whenever $x_{i j}>0$, then $f(x) \leqslant f\left(x^{\prime}\right) .$

Let $x^{*}$ be the initial feasible solution that is obtained by formulating $\mathrm{P}$ as a transportation problem and using a greedy method that starts in the upper left of the matrix $\left(x_{i j}\right)$. Show that if $a+2 \leqslant b$ then $x^{*}$ minimizes $f$.

For what values of $a$ and $b$ is one step of the transportation algorithm sufficient to pivot from $x^{*}$ to a solution that maximizes $f$ ?
