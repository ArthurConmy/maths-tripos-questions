Let $R$ be a ring and $M$ an $R$-module. What does it mean to say that $M$ is a free $R$-module? Show that $M$ is free if there exists a submodule $N \subseteq M$ such that both $N$ and $M / N$ are free.

Let $M$ and $M^{\prime}$ be $R$-modules, and $N \subseteq M, N^{\prime} \subseteq M^{\prime}$ submodules. Suppose that $N \cong N^{\prime}$ and $M / N \cong M^{\prime} / N^{\prime}$. Determine (by proof or counterexample) which of the following statements holds:

(1) If $N$ is free then $M \cong M^{\prime}$.

(2) If $M / N$ is free then $M \cong M^{\prime}$.
