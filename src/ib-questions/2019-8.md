Define the winding number $n(\gamma, w)$ of a closed path $\gamma:[a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ around a point $w \in \mathbb{C}$ which does not lie on the image of $\gamma$. [You do not need to justify its existence.]

If $f$ is a meromorphic function, define the order of a zero $z_{0}$ of $f$ and of a pole $w_{0}$ of $f$. State the Argument Principle, and explain how it can be deduced from the Residue Theorem.

How many roots of the polynomial

$$z^{4}+10 z^{3}+4 z^{2}+10 z+5$$

lie in the right-hand half plane?
