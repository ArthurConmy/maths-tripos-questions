Starting from the relevant Maxwell equation, derive Gauss's law in integral form.

Use Gauss's law to obtain the potential at a distance $r$ from an infinite straight wire with charge $\lambda$ per unit length.

Write down the potential due to two infinite wires parallel to the $z$-axis, one at $x=y=0$ with charge $\lambda$ per unit length and the other at $x=0, y=d$ with charge $-\lambda$ per unit length.

Find the potential and the electric field in the limit $d \rightarrow 0$ with $\lambda d=p$ where $p$ is fixed. Sketch the equipotentials and the electric field lines.
