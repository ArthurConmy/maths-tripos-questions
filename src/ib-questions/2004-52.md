Write down the Lorentz transformation with one space dimension between two inertial frames $S$ and $S^{\prime}$ moving relatively to one another at speed $V$.

A particle moves at velocity $u$ in frame $S$. Find its velocity $u^{\prime}$ in frame $S^{\prime}$ and show that $u^{\prime}$ is always less than $c$.
