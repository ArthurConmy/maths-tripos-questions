Let $G$ be a group, and $H$ a subgroup of finite index. By considering an appropriate action of $G$ on the set of left cosets of $H$, prove that $H$ always contains a normal subgroup $K$ of $G$ such that the index of $K$ in $G$ is finite and divides $n$ !, where $n$ is the index of $H$ in $G$.

Now assume that $G$ is a finite group of order $p q$, where $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers with $p<q$. Prove that the subgroup of $G$ generated by any element of order $q$ is necessarily normal.
