What is meant by the Jordan normal form of an $n \times n$ complex matrix?

Find the Jordan normal forms of the following matrices:

$$\left(\begin{array}{llll}
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right), \quad\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
-1 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & -1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & -1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & -1
\end{array}\right), \quad\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
3 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
3 & 3 & 0 & 0 \\
9 & 6 & 3 & 0 \\
15 & 12 & 9 & 3
\end{array}\right)$$

Suppose $A$ is an invertible $n \times n$ complex matrix. Explain how to derive the characteristic and minimal polynomials of $A^{n}$ from the characteristic and minimal polynomials of $A$. Justify your answer. [Hint: write each polynomial as a product of linear factors.]
