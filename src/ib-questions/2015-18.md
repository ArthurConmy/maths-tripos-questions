Consider the magnetic field

$$\mathbf{B}=b[\mathbf{r}+(k \hat{\mathbf{z}}+l \hat{\mathbf{y}}) \hat{\mathbf{z}} \cdot \mathbf{r}+p \hat{\mathbf{x}}(\hat{\mathbf{y}} \cdot \mathbf{r})+n \hat{\mathbf{z}}(\hat{\mathbf{x}} \cdot \mathbf{r})],$$

where $b \neq 0, \mathbf{r}=(x, y, z)$ and $\hat{\mathbf{x}}, \hat{\mathbf{y}}, \hat{\mathbf{z}}$ are unit vectors in the $x, y$ and $z$ directions, respectively. Imposing that this satisfies the expected equations for a static magnetic field in a vacuum, find $k, l, n$ and $p$.

A circular wire loop of radius $a$, mass $m$ and resistance $R$ lies in the $(x, y)$ plane with its centre on the $z$-axis at $z$ and a magnetic field as given above. Calculate the magnetic flux through the loop arising from this magnetic field and also the force acting on the loop when a current $I$ is flowing around the loop in a clockwise direction about the $z$-axis.

At $t=0$, the centre of the loop is at the origin, travelling with velocity $(0,0, v(t=0))$, where $v(0)>0$. Ignoring gravity and relativistic effects, and assuming that $I$ is only the induced current, find the time taken for the speed to halve in terms of $a, b, R$ and $m$. By what factor does the rate of heat generation change in this time?

Where is the loop as $t \rightarrow \infty$ as a function of $a, b, R, v(0) ?$
