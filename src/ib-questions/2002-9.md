Let $\mathbb{H}=\{x+i y \in \mathbb{C}: y>0\}$, and let $\mathbb{H}$ have the hyperbolic metric $\rho$ derived from the line element $|d z| / y$. Let $\Gamma$ be the group of MÃ¶bius maps of the form $z \mapsto(a z+b) /(c z+d)$, where $a, b, c$ and $d$ are real and $a d-b c=1$. Show that every $g$ in $\Gamma$ is an isometry of the metric space $(\mathbb{H}, \rho)$. For $z$ and $w$ in $\mathbb{H}$, let

$$h(z, w)=\frac{|z-w|^{2}}{\operatorname{Im}(z) \operatorname{Im}(w)}$$

Show that for every $g$ in $\Gamma, h(g(z), g(w))=h(z, w)$. By considering $z=i y$, where $y>1$, and $w=i$, or otherwise, show that for all $z$ and $w$ in $\mathbb{H}$,

$$\cosh \rho(z, w)=1+\frac{|z-w|^{2}}{2 \operatorname{Im}(z) \operatorname{Im}(w)}$$

By considering points $i, i y$, where $y>1$ and $s+i t$, where $s^{2}+t^{2}=1$, or otherwise, derive Pythagoras' Theorem for hyperbolic geometry in the form $\cosh a \cosh b=\cosh c$, where $a, b$ and $c$ are the lengths of sides of a right-angled triangle whose hypotenuse has length $c$.
