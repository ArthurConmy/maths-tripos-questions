Find the Fourier sine series for $f(x)=x$, on $0 \leqslant x<L$. To which value does the series converge at $x=\frac{3}{2} L$ ?

Now consider the corresponding cosine series for $f(x)=x$, on $0 \leqslant x<L$. Sketch the cosine series between $x=-2 L$ and $x=2 L$. To which value does the series converge at $x=\frac{3}{2} L$ ? [You do not need to determine the cosine series explicitly.]
