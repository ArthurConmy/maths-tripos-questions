Define an embedded parametrised surface in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. What is the Riemannian metric induced by a parametrisation? State, in terms of the Riemannian metric, the equations defining a geodesic curve $\gamma:(0,1) \rightarrow S$, assuming that $\gamma$ is parametrised by arc-length.

Let $S$ be a conical surface

$$S=\left\{(x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^{3}: 3\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)=z^{2}, \quad z>0\right\}$$

Using an appropriate smooth parametrisation, or otherwise, prove that $S$ is locally isometric to the Euclidean plane. Show that any two points on $S$ can be joined by a geodesic. Is this geodesic always unique (up to a reparametrisation)? Justify your answer.

[The expression for the Euclidean metric in polar coordinates on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ may be used without proof.]
