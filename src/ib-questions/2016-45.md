(a) Prove that every open communicating class of a Markov chain is transient. Prove that every finite transient communicating class is open. Give an example of a Markov chain with an infinite transient closed communicating class.

(b) Consider a Markov chain $\left(X_{n}\right)_{n \geqslant 0}$ with state space $\{a, b, c, d\}$ and transition probabilities given by the matrix

$$P=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
1 / 3 & 0 & 1 / 3 & 1 / 3 \\
0 & 1 / 4 & 0 & 3 / 4 \\
1 / 2 & 1 / 2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 2 / 3 & 0 & 1 / 3
\end{array}\right)$$

(i) Compute $\mathbb{P}\left(X_{n}=b \mid X_{0}=d\right)$ for a fixed $n \geqslant 0$.

(ii) Compute $\mathbb{P}\left(X_{n}=c\right.$ for some $\left.n \geqslant 1 \mid X_{0}=a\right)$.

(iii) Show that $P^{n}$ converges as $n \rightarrow \infty$, and determine the limit.
