Let $a, b, c$ be the lengths of a right-angled triangle in spherical geometry, where $c$ is the hypotenuse. Prove the Pythagorean theorem for spherical geometry in the form

$$\cos c=\cos a \cos b$$

Now consider such a spherical triangle with the sides $a, b$ replaced by $\lambda a, \lambda b$ for a positive number $\lambda$. Show that the above formula approaches the usual Pythagorean theorem as $\lambda$ approaches zero.
