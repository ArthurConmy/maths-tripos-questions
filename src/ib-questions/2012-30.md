What does it mean to say that the finite group $G$ acts on the set $\Omega$ ?

By considering an action of the symmetry group of a regular tetrahedron on a set of pairs of edges, show there is a surjective homomorphism $S_{4} \rightarrow S_{3}$.

[You may assume that the symmetric group $S_{n}$ is generated by transpositions.]
