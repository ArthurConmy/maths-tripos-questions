For a Markov chain with state space $S$, define what is meant by the following:

(i) states $i, j \in S$ communicate;

(ii) state $i \in S$ is recurrent.

Prove that communication is an equivalence relation on $S$ and that if two states $i, j$ communicate and $i$ is recurrent then $j$ is recurrent.
