Two incompressible fluids flow in infinite horizontal streams, the plane of contact being $z=0$, with $z$ positive upwards. The flow is given by

$$\mathbf{U}(\mathbf{r})= \begin{cases}U_{2} \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{x}, & z>0 \\ U_{1} \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{x}, & z<0\end{cases}$$

where $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{x}$ is the unit vector in the positive $x$ direction. The upper fluid has density $\rho_{2}$ and pressure $p_{0}-g \rho_{2} z$, the lower has density $\rho_{1}$ and pressure $p_{0}-g \rho_{1} z$, where $p_{0}$ is a constant and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

(i) Consider a perturbation to the flat surface $z=0$ of the form

$$z \equiv \zeta(x, y, t)=\zeta_{0} e^{i(k x+\ell y)+s t} .$$

State the kinematic boundary conditions on the velocity potentials $\phi_{i}$ that hold on the interface in the two domains, and show by linearising in $\zeta$ that they reduce to

$$\frac{\partial \phi_{i}}{\partial z}=\frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial t}+U_{i} \frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial x} \quad(z=0, i=1,2) .$$

(ii) State the dynamic boundary condition on the perturbed interface, and show by linearising in $\zeta$ that it reduces to

$$\rho_{1}\left(U_{1} \frac{\partial \phi_{1}}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial \phi_{1}}{\partial t}+g \zeta\right)=\rho_{2}\left(U_{2} \frac{\partial \phi_{2}}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial \phi_{2}}{\partial t}+g \zeta\right) \quad(z=0)$$

(iii) Use the velocity potentials

$$\phi_{1}=U_{1} x+A_{1} e^{q z} e^{i(k x+\ell y)+s t}, \quad \phi_{2}=U_{2} x+A_{2} e^{-q z} e^{i(k x+\ell y)+s t},$$

where $q=\sqrt{k^{2}+\ell^{2}}$, and the conditions in (i) and (ii) to perform a stability analysis. Show that the relation between $s, k$ and $\ell$ is

$$s=-i k \frac{\rho_{1} U_{1}+\rho_{2} U_{2}}{\rho_{1}+\rho_{2}} \pm\left[\frac{k^{2} \rho_{1} \rho_{2}\left(U_{1}-U_{2}\right)^{2}}{\left(\rho_{1}+\rho_{2}\right)^{2}}-\frac{q g\left(\rho_{1}-\rho_{2}\right)}{\rho_{1}+\rho_{2}}\right]^{1 / 2} .$$

Find the criterion for instability.
