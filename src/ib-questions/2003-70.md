Let $X_{1}, \ldots, X_{n}$ be a random sample from the $N\left(\theta, \sigma^{2}\right)$ distribution, and suppose that the prior distribution for $\theta$ is $N\left(\mu, \tau^{2}\right)$, where $\sigma^{2}, \mu, \tau^{2}$ are known. Determine the posterior distribution for $\theta$, given $X_{1}, \ldots, X_{n}$, and the best point estimate of $\theta$ under both quadratic and absolute error loss.
