Let $H$ be the domain $\mathbb{C}-\{x+i y: x \leq 0, y=0\}$ (i.e., $\mathbb{C}$ cut along the negative $x$-axis). Show, by a suitable choice of branch, that the mapping

$$z \mapsto w=-i \log z$$

maps $H$ onto the strip $S=\{z=x+i y,-\pi<x<\pi\}$.

How would a different choice of branch change the result?

Let $G$ be the domain $\{z \in \mathbb{C}:|z|<1,|z+i|>\sqrt{2}\}$. Find an analytic transformation that maps $G$ to $S$, where $S$ is the strip defined above.
