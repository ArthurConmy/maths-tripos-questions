Show that any finite group of orientation-preserving isometries of the Euclidean plane is cyclic.

Show that any finite group of orientation-preserving isometries of the hyperbolic plane is cyclic.

[You may assume that given any non-empty finite set $E$ in the hyperbolic plane, or the Euclidean plane, there is a unique smallest closed disc that contains E. You may also use any general fact about the hyperbolic plane without proof providing that it is stated carefully.]
