(a) Let $\alpha: V \rightarrow W$ be a linear transformation between finite dimensional vector spaces over a field $F=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.

Define the dual map of $\alpha$. Let $\delta$ be the dual map of $\alpha$. Given a subspace $U \subseteq V$, define the annihilator $U^{\circ}$ of $U$. Show that $(\operatorname{ker} \alpha)^{\circ}$ and the image of $\delta$ coincide. Conclude that the dimension of the image of $\alpha$ is equal to the dimension of the image of $\delta$. Show that $\operatorname{dim} \operatorname{ker}(\alpha)-\operatorname{dim} \operatorname{ker}(\delta)=\operatorname{dim} V-\operatorname{dim} W$.

(b) Now suppose in addition that $V, W$ are inner product spaces. Define the adjoint $\alpha^{*}$ of $\alpha$. Let $\beta: U \rightarrow V, \gamma: V \rightarrow W$ be linear transformations between finite dimensional inner product spaces. Suppose that the image of $\beta$ is equal to the kernel of $\gamma$. Then show that $\beta \beta^{*}+\gamma^{*} \gamma$ is an isomorphism.
