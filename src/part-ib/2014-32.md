Let $G$ be a finite group and $p$ a prime divisor of the order of $G$. Give the definition of a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$, and state Sylow's theorems.

Let $p$ and $q$ be distinct primes. Prove that a group of order $p^{2} q$ is not simple.

Let $G$ be a finite group, $H$ a normal subgroup of $G$ and $P$ a Sylow $p$-subgroup of H. Let $N_{G}(P)$ denote the normaliser of $P$ in $G$. Prove that if $g \in G$ then there exist $k \in N_{G}(P)$ and $h \in H$ such that $g=k h$.
