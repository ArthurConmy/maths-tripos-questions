Define what it means for an $n \times n$ complex matrix to be unitary or Hermitian. Show that every eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix is real. Show that every eigenvalue of a unitary matrix has absolute value 1 .

Show that two eigenvectors of a Hermitian matrix that correspond to different eigenvalues are orthogonal, using the standard inner product on $\mathbf{C}^{n}$.
