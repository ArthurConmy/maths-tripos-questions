The spherically symmetric bound state wavefunctions $\psi(r)$ for the Coulomb potential $V=-e^{2} /\left(4 \pi \epsilon_{0} r\right)$ are normalisable solutions of the equation

$$\frac{d^{2} \psi}{d r^{2}}+\frac{2}{r} \frac{d \psi}{d r}+\frac{2 \lambda}{r} \psi=-\frac{2 m E}{\hbar^{2}} \psi$$

Here $\lambda=\left(m e^{2}\right) /\left(4 \pi \epsilon_{0} \hbar^{2}\right)$ and $E<0$ is the energy of the state.

(a) By writing the wavefunction as $\psi(r)=f(r) \exp (-K r)$, for a suitable constant $K$ that you should determine, show that there are normalisable wavefunctions $\psi(r)$ only for energies of the form

$$E=\frac{-m e^{4}}{32 \pi^{2} \epsilon_{0}^{2} \hbar^{2} N^{2}}$$

with $N$ being a positive integer.

(b) The energies in (a) reproduce the predictions of the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom. How do the wavefunctions above compare to the assumptions in the Bohr model?
