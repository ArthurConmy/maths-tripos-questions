Let $w=u+i v$ and let $z=x+i y$, for $u, v, x, y$ real.

(a) Let A be the map defined by $w=\sqrt{z}$, using the principal branch. Show that A maps the region to the left of the parabola $y^{2}=4(1-x)$ on the $z-$ plane, with the negative real axis $x \in(-\infty, 0]$ removed, into the vertical strip of the $w-$ plane between the lines $u=0$ and $u=1$.

(b) Let $\mathrm{B}$ be the map defined by $w=\tan ^{2}(z / 2)$. Show that $\mathrm{B}$ maps the vertical strip of the $z$-plane between the lines $x=0$ and $x=\pi / 2$ into the region inside the unit circle on the $w$-plane, with the part $u \in(-1,0]$ of the negative real axis removed.

(c) Using the results of parts (a) and (b), show that the map C, defined by $w=\tan ^{2}(\pi \sqrt{z} / 4)$, maps the region to the left of the parabola $y^{2}=4(1-x)$ on the $z$-plane, including the negative real axis, onto the unit disc on the $w$-plane.
