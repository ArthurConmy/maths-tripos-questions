Define $\mathbb{H}$, the upper half plane model for the hyperbolic plane, and show that $\operatorname{PSL}_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ acts on $\mathbb{H}$ by isometries, and that these isometries preserve the orientation of $\mathbb{H}$.

Show that every orientation preserving isometry of $\mathbb{H}$ is in $P S L_{2}(\mathbb{R})$, and hence the full group of isometries of $\mathbb{H}$ is $G=P S L_{2}(\mathbb{R}) \cup P S L_{2}(\mathbb{R}) \tau$, where $\tau z=-\bar{z}$.

Let $\ell$ be a hyperbolic line. Define the reflection $\sigma_{\ell}$ in $\ell$. Now let $\ell, \ell^{\prime}$ be two hyperbolic lines which meet at a point $A \in \mathbb{H}$ at an angle $\theta$. What are the possibilities for the group $G$ generated by $\sigma_{\ell}$ and $\sigma_{\ell^{\prime}}$ ? Carefully justify your answer.
