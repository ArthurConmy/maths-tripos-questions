Let $R$ be an integral domain and $R^{\times}$its group of units. An element of $S=R \backslash\left(R^{\times} \cup\{0\}\right)$ is irreducible if it is not a product of two elements in $S$. When $R$ is Noetherian, show that every element of $S$ is a product of finitely many irreducible elements of $S$.
