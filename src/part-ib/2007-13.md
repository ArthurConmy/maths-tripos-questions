A regular icosahedron has 20 faces, 12 vertices and 30 edges. The group $G$ of its rotations acts transitively on the set of faces, on the set of vertices and on the set of edges.

(i) List the conjugacy classes in $G$ and give the size of each.

(ii) Find the order of $G$ and list its normal subgroups.

[A normal subgroup of $G$ is a union of conjugacy classes in $G$.]
