(i) Suppose that $G$ is a finite group of order $p^{n} r$, where $p$ is prime and does not divide $r$. Prove the first Sylow theorem, that $G$ has at least one subgroup of order $p^{n}$, and state the remaining Sylow theorems without proof.

(ii) Suppose that $p, q$ are distinct primes. Show that there is no simple group of order $p q$.
