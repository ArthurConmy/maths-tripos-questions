A layer of thickness $h_{1}$ of a fluid of density $\rho_{1}$ is located above a layer of thickness $h_{2}$ of a fluid of density $\rho_{2}>\rho_{1}$. The two-fluid system is bounded by two impenetrable surfaces at $y=h_{1}$ and $y=-h_{2}$ and is assumed to be two-dimensional (i.e. independent of $z$ ). The fluid is subsequently perturbed, and the interface between the two fluids is denoted $y=\eta(x, t)$.

(a) Assuming irrotational motion in each fluid, state the equations and boundary conditions satisfied by the flow potentials, $\varphi_{1}$ and $\varphi_{2}$.

(b) The interface is perturbed by small-amplitude waves of the form $\eta=\eta_{0} e^{i(k x-\omega t)}$, with $\eta_{0} k \ll 1$. State the equations and boundary conditions satisfied by the linearised system.

(c) Calculate the dispersion relation of the waves relating the frequency $\omega$ to the wavenumber $k$.
