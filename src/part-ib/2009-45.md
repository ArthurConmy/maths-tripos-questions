A gerbil is introduced into a maze at the node labelled 0 in the diagram. It roams at random through the maze until it reaches the node labelled 1. At each vertex, it chooses to move to one of the neighbouring nodes with equal probability, independently of all other choices. Find the mean number of moves required for the gerbil to reach node 1 .

Suppose now that the gerbil is intelligent, in that when it reaches a node it will not immediately return to the node from which it has just come, choosing with equal probability from all other neighbouring nodes. Express the movement of the gerbil in terms of a Markov chain whose states and transition probabilities you should specify. Find the mean number of moves until the intelligent gerbil reaches node 1 . Compare with your answer to the first part, and comment briefly.
