What is meant by stereographic projection from the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ to the complex plane? Briefly explain why a spherical triangle cannot map to a Euclidean triangle under stereographic projection.

Derive an explicit formula for stereographic projection. Hence, or otherwise, prove that if a Möbius map corresponds via stereographic projection to a rotation of the sphere, it has two fixed points $p$ and $q$ which satisfy $p \bar{q}=-1$. Give, with justification:

(i) a Möbius transformation which fixes a pair of points $p, q \in \mathbb{C}$ satisfying $p \bar{q}=-1$ but which does not arise from a rotation of the sphere;

(ii) an isometry of the sphere (for the spherical metric) which does not correspond to any Möbius transformation under stereographic projection.
