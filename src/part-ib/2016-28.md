Let $\alpha(s)=(f(s), g(s))$ be a simple curve in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ parameterised by arc length with $f(s)>0$ for all $s$, and consider the surface of revolution $S$ in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ defined by the parameterisation

$$\sigma(u, v)=(f(u) \cos v, f(u) \sin v, g(u))$$

(a) Calculate the first and second fundamental forms for $S$. Show that the Gaussian curvature of $S$ is given by

$$K=-\frac{f^{\prime \prime}(u)}{f(u)}$$

(b) Now take $f(s)=\cos s+2, g(s)=\sin s, 0 \leqslant s<2 \pi$. What is the integral of the Gaussian curvature over the surface of revolution $S$ determined by $f$ and $g$ ?

[You may use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem without proof.]

(c) Now suppose $S$ has constant curvature $K \equiv 1$, and suppose there are two points $P_{1}, P_{2} \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$ such that $S \cup\left\{P_{1}, P_{2}\right\}$ is a smooth closed embedded surface. Show that $S$ is a unit sphere, minus two antipodal points.

[Do not attempt to integrate an expression of the form $\sqrt{1-C^{2} \sin ^{2} u}$ when $C \neq 1$. Study the behaviour of the surface at the largest and smallest possible values of $u$.]
