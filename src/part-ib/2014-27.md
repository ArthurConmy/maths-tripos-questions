Let $H=\{x+i y: x, y \in \mathbb{R}, y>0\} \subset \mathbb{C}$ be the upper half-plane with a hyperbolic metric $g=\frac{d x^{2}+d y^{2}}{y^{2}}$. Prove that every hyperbolic circle $C$ in $H$ is also a Euclidean circle. Is the centre of $C$ as a hyperbolic circle always the same point as the centre of $C$ as a Euclidean circle? Give a proof or counterexample as appropriate.

Let $A B C$ and $A^{\prime} B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ be two hyperbolic triangles and denote the hyperbolic lengths of their sides by $a, b, c$ and $a^{\prime}, b^{\prime}, c^{\prime}$, respectively. Show that if $a=a^{\prime}, b=b^{\prime}$ and $c=c^{\prime}$, then there is a hyperbolic isometry taking $A B C$ to $A^{\prime} B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$. Is there always such an isometry if instead the triangles have one angle the same and $a=a^{\prime}, b=b^{\prime} ?$ Justify your answer.

[Standard results on hyperbolic isometries may be assumed, provided they are clearly stated.]
