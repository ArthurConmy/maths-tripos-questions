(i) State a structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups.

(ii) If $K$ is a field and $f$ a polynomial of degree $n$ in one variable over $K$, what is the maximal number of zeroes of $f$ ? Justify your answer in terms of unique factorization in some polynomial ring, or otherwise.

(iii) Show that any finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of non-zero elements of a field is cyclic. Is this true if the subgroup is allowed to be infinite?
