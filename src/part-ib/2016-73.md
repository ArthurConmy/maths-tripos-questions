The efficacy of a new medicine was tested as follows. Fifty patients were given the medicine, and another fifty patients were given a placebo. A week later, the number of patients who got better, stayed the same, or got worse was recorded, as summarised in this table:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline & medicine & placebo \\
better & 28 & 22 \\
same & 4 & 16 \\
worse & 18 & 12 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Conduct a Pearson chi-squared test of size $1 \%$ of the hypothesis that the medicine and the placebo have the same effect.
