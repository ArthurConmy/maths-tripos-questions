(a) Define the cross-ratio $\left[z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}, z_{4}\right]$ of four distinct points $z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}, z_{4} \in \mathbb{C} \cup\{\infty\}$. Show that the cross-ratio is invariant under MÃ¶bius transformations. Express $\left[z_{2}, z_{1}, z_{3}, z_{4}\right]$ in terms of $\left[z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}, z_{4}\right]$.

(b) Show that $\left[z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}, z_{4}\right]$ is real if and only if $z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}, z_{4}$ lie on a line or circle in $\mathbb{C} \cup\{\infty\}$.

(c) Let $z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}, z_{4}$ lie on a circle in $\mathbb{C}$, given in anti-clockwise order as depicted.

Show that $\left[z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}, z_{4}\right]$ is a negative real number, and that $\left[z_{2}, z_{1}, z_{3}, z_{4}\right]$ is a positive real number greater than 1 . Show that $\left|\left[z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}, z_{4}\right]\right|+1=\left|\left[z_{2}, z_{1}, z_{3}, z_{4}\right]\right|$. Use this to deduce Ptolemy's relation on lengths of edges and diagonals of the inscribed 4-gon:

$$\left|z_{1}-z_{3}\right|\left|z_{2}-z_{4}\right|=\left|z_{1}-z_{2}\right|\left|z_{3}-z_{4}\right|+\left|z_{2}-z_{3}\right|\left|z_{4}-z_{1}\right|$$
