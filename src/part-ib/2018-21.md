A layer of fluid of dynamic viscosity $\mu$, density $\rho$ and uniform thickness $h$ flows down a rigid vertical plane. The adjacent air has uniform pressure $p_{0}$ and exerts a tangential stress on the fluid that is proportional to the surface velocity and opposes the flow, with constant of proportionality $k$. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.

(a) Draw a diagram of this situation, including indications of the applied stresses and body forces, a suitable coordinate system and a representation of the expected velocity profile.

(b) Write down the equations and boundary conditions governing the flow, with a brief description of each, paying careful attention to signs. Solve these equations to determine the pressure and velocity fields in terms of the parameters given above.

(c) Show that the surface velocity of the fluid layer is $\frac{\rho g h^{2}}{2 \mu}\left(1+\frac{k h}{\mu}\right)^{-1}$.

(d) Determine the volume flux per unit width of the plane for general values of $k$ and its limiting values when $k \rightarrow 0$ and $k \rightarrow \infty$.
