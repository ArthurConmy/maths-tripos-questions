A continuous wire of resistance $R$ is wound around a very long right circular cylinder of radius $a$, and length $l$ (long enough so that end effects can be ignored). There are $N \gg 1$ turns of wire per unit length, wound in a spiral of very small pitch. Initially, the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ is $\mathbf{0}$.

Both ends of the coil are attached to a battery of electromotance $\mathcal{E}_{0}$ at $t=0$, which induces a current $I(t)$. Use Amp√®re's law to derive $\mathbf{B}$ inside and outside the cylinder when the displacement current may be neglected. Write the self-inductance of the coil $L$ in terms of the quantities given above. Using Ohm's law and Faraday's law of induction, find $I(t)$ explicitly in terms of $\mathcal{E}_{0}, R, L$ and $t$.
