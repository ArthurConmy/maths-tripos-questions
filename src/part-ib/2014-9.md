Let $f(z)$ be an analytic/holomorphic function defined on an open set $D$, and let $z_{0} \in D$ be a point such that $f^{\prime}\left(z_{0}\right) \neq 0$. Show that the transformation $w=f(z)$ preserves the angle between smooth curves intersecting at $z_{0}$. Find such a transformation $w=f(z)$ that maps the second quadrant of the unit disc (i.e. $|z|<1, \pi / 2<\arg (z)<\pi)$ to the region in the first quadrant of the complex plane where $|w|>1$ (i.e. the region in the first quadrant outside the unit circle).
