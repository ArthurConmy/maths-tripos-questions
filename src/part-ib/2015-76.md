(a) Suppose that $X_{1}, \ldots, X_{n}$ are independent identically distributed random variables, each with density $f(x)=\theta \exp (-\theta x), x>0$ for some unknown $\theta>0$. Use the generalised likelihood ratio to obtain a size $\alpha$ test of $H_{0}: \theta=1$ against $H_{1}: \theta \neq 1$.

(b) A die is loaded so that, if $p_{i}$ is the probability of face $i$, then $p_{1}=p_{2}=\theta_{1}$, $p_{3}=p_{4}=\theta_{2}$ and $p_{5}=p_{6}=\theta_{3}$. The die is thrown $n$ times and face $i$ is observed $x_{i}$ times. Write down the likelihood function for $\theta=\left(\theta_{1}, \theta_{2}, \theta_{3}\right)$ and find the maximum likelihood estimate of $\theta$.

Consider testing whether or not $\theta_{1}=\theta_{2}=\theta_{3}$ for this die. Find the generalised likelihood ratio statistic $\Lambda$ and show that

$$2 \log _{e} \Lambda \approx T, \quad \text { where } T=\sum_{i=1}^{3} \frac{\left(o_{i}-e_{i}\right)^{2}}{e_{i}}$$

where you should specify $o_{i}$ and $e_{i}$ in terms of $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{6}$. Explain how to obtain an approximate size $0.05$ test using the value of $T$. Explain what you would conclude (and why ) if $T=2.03$.
