State and prove Rouché's theorem, and use it to count the number of zeros of $3 z^{9}+8 z^{6}+z^{5}+2 z^{3}+1$ inside the annulus $\{z: 1<|z|<2\}$.

Let $\left(p_{n}\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of polynomials of degree at most $d$ with the property that $p_{n}(z)$ converges uniformly on compact subsets of $\mathbb{C}$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. Prove that there is a polynomial $p$ of degree at most $d$ such that $p_{n} \rightarrow p$ uniformly on compact subsets of $\mathbb{C}$. [If you use any results about uniform convergence of analytic functions, you should prove them.]

Suppose that $p$ has $d$ distinct roots $z_{1}, \ldots, z_{d}$. Using Rouché's theorem, or otherwise, show that for each $i$ there is a sequence $\left(z_{i, n}\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ such that $p_{n}\left(z_{i, n}\right)=0$ and $z_{i, n} \rightarrow z_{i}$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.
