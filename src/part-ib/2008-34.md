Suppose that $f$ and $g$ are two functions which are analytic on the whole complex plane $\mathbb{C}$. Suppose that there is a sequence of distinct points $z_{1}, z_{2}, \ldots$ with $\left|z_{i}\right| \leqslant 1$ such that $f\left(z_{i}\right)=g\left(z_{i}\right)$. Show that $f(z)=g(z)$ for all $z \in \mathbb{C}$. [You may assume any results on Taylor expansions you need, provided they are clearly stated.]

What happens if the assumption that $\left|z_{i}\right| \leqslant 1$ is dropped?
