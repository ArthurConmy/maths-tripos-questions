Let $\gamma$ be a curve (not necessarily closed) in $\mathbb{C}$ and let $[\gamma]$ denote the image of $\gamma$. Let $\phi:[\gamma] \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be a continuous function and define

$$f(z)=\int_{\gamma} \frac{\phi(\lambda)}{\lambda-z} d \lambda$$

for $z \in \mathbb{C} \backslash[\gamma]$. Show that $f$ has a power series expansion about every $a \notin[\gamma]$.

Using Cauchy's Integral Formula, show that a holomorphic function has complex derivatives of all orders. [Properties of power series may be assumed without proof.] Let $f$ be a holomorphic function on an open set $U$ that contains the closed disc $\bar{D}(a, r)$. Obtain an integral formula for the derivative of $f$ on the open disc $D(a, r)$ in terms of the values of $f$ on the boundary of the disc.

Show that if holomorphic functions $f_{n}$ on an open set $U$ converge locally uniformly to a holomorphic function $f$ on $U$, then $f_{n}^{\prime}$ converges locally uniformly to $f^{\prime}$.

Let $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ be two overlapping closed discs. Let $f$ be a holomorphic function on some open neighbourhood of $D=D_{1} \cap D_{2}$. Show that there exist open neighbourhoods $U_{j}$ of $D_{j}$ and holomorphic functions $f_{j}$ on $U_{j}, j=1,2$, such that $f(z)=f_{1}(z)+f_{2}(z)$ on $U_{1} \cap U_{2}$.
