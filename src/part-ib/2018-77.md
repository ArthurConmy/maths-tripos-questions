Find, using a Lagrange multiplier, the four stationary points in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ of the function $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}$ subject to the constraint $x^{2}+2 y^{2}-z^{2}=1$. By sketching sections of the constraint surface in each of the coordinate planes, or otherwise, identify the nature of the constrained stationary points.

How would the location of the stationary points differ if, instead, the function $x^{2}+2 y^{2}-z^{2}$ were subject to the constraint $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1 ?$
