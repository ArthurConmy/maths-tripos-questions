Define uniform continuity for a real-valued function on an interval in the real line. Is a uniformly continuous function on the real line necessarily bounded?

Which of the following functions are uniformly continuous on the real line?

(i) $f(x)=x \sin x$,

(ii) $f(x)=e^{-x^{4}}$.

Justify your answers.
