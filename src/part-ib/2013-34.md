Let $R=\mathbb{C}[X, Y]$ be the polynomial ring in two variables over the complex numbers, and consider the principal ideal $I=\left(X^{3}-Y^{2}\right)$ of $R$.

(i) Using the fact that $R$ is a UFD, show that $I$ is a prime ideal of $R$. [Hint: Elements in $\mathbb{C}[X, Y]$ are polynomials in $Y$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{C}[X] .]$

(ii) Show that $I$ is not a maximal ideal of $R$, and that it is contained in infinitely many distinct proper ideals in $R$.
