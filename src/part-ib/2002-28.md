Write down the transformation law for the components of a second-rank tensor $A_{i j}$ explaining the meaning of the symbols that you use.

A tensor is said to have cubic symmetry if its components are unchanged by rotations of $\pi / 2$ about each of the three co-ordinate axes. Find the most general secondrank tensor having cubic symmetry.
