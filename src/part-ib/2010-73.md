A washing powder manufacturer wants to determine the effectiveness of a television advertisement. Before the advertisement is shown, a pollster asks 100 randomly chosen people which of the three most popular washing powders, labelled $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$ and $\mathrm{C}$, they prefer. After the advertisement is shown, another 100 randomly chosen people (not the same as before) are asked the same question. The results are summarized below.

\begin{tabular}{c|ccc} 
& $\mathrm{A}$ & $\mathrm{B}$ & $\mathrm{C}$ \\
\hline before & 36 & 47 & 17 \\
after & 44 & 33 & 23
\end{tabular}

Derive and carry out an appropriate test at the $5 \%$ significance level of the hypothesis that the advertisement has had no effect on people's preferences.
