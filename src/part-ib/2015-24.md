(i) Give a model for the hyperbolic plane. In this choice of model, describe hyperbolic lines.

Show that if $\ell_{1}, \ell_{2}$ are two hyperbolic lines and $p_{1} \in \ell_{1}, p_{2} \in \ell_{2}$ are points, then there exists an isometry $g$ of the hyperbolic plane such that $g\left(\ell_{1}\right)=\ell_{2}$ and $g\left(p_{1}\right)=p_{2}$.

(ii) Let $T$ be a triangle in the hyperbolic plane with angles $30^{\circ}, 30^{\circ}$ and $45^{\circ}$. What is the area of $T$ ?
