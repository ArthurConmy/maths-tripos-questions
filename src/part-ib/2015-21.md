A fluid layer of depth $h_{1}$ and dynamic viscosity $\mu_{1}$ is located underneath a fluid layer of depth $h_{2}$ and dynamic viscosity $\mu_{2}$. The total fluid system of depth $h=h_{1}+h_{2}$ is positioned between a stationary rigid plate at $y=0$ and a rigid plate at $y=h$ moving with speed $\mathbf{U}=U \hat{\mathbf{x}}$, where $U$ is constant. Ignore the effects of gravity.

(i) Using dimensional analysis only, and the fact that the stress should be linear in $U$, derive the expected form of the shear stress acted by the fluid on the plate at $y=0$ as a function of $U, h_{1}, h_{2}, \mu_{1}$ and $\mu_{2}$.

(ii) Solve for the unidirectional velocity profile between the two plates. State clearly all boundary conditions you are using to solve this problem.

(iii) Compute the exact value of the shear stress acted by the fluid on the plate at $y=0$. Compare with the results in (i).

(iv) What is the condition on the viscosity of the bottom layer, $\mu_{1}$, for the stress in (iii) to be smaller than it would be if the fluid had constant viscosity $\mu_{2}$ in both layers?

(v) Show that the stress acting on the plate at $y=h$ is equal and opposite to the stress on the plate at $y=0$ and justify this result physically.
