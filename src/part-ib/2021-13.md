State Gauss's Law in the context of electrostatics.

A simple coaxial cable consists of an inner conductor in the form of a perfectly conducting, solid cylinder of radius $a$, surrounded by an outer conductor in the form of a perfectly conducting, cylindrical shell of inner radius $b>a$ and outer radius $c>b$. The cylinders are coaxial and the gap between them is filled with a perfectly insulating material. The cable may be assumed to be straight and arbitrarily long.

In a steady state, the inner conductor carries an electric charge $+Q$ per unit length, and the outer conductor carries an electric charge $-Q$ per unit length. The charges are distributed in a cylindrically symmetric way and no current flows through the cable.

Determine the electrostatic potential and the electric field as functions of the cylindrical radius $r$, for $0<r<\infty$. Calculate the capacitance $C$ of the cable per unit length and the electrostatic energy $U$ per unit length, and verify that these are related by

$$U=\frac{Q^{2}}{2 C}$$
