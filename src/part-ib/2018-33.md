(a) State the classification theorem for finitely generated modules over a Euclidean domain.

(b) Deduce the existence of the rational canonical form for an $n \times n$ matrix $A$ over a field $F$.

(c) Compute the rational canonical form of the matrix

$$A=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
3 / 2 & 1 & 0 \\
-1 & -1 / 2 & 0 \\
2 & 2 & 1 / 2
\end{array}\right)$$
