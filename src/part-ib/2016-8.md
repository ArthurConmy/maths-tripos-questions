(a) Prove Cauchy's theorem for a triangle.

(b) Write down an expression for the winding number $I(\gamma, a)$ of a closed, piecewise continuously differentiable curve $\gamma$ about a point $a \in \mathbb{C}$ which does not lie on $\gamma$.

(c) Let $U \subset \mathbb{C}$ be a domain, and $f: U \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ a holomorphic function with no zeroes in $U$. Suppose that for infinitely many positive integers $k$ the function $f$ has a holomorphic $k$-th root. Show that there exists a holomorphic function $F: U \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ such that $f=\exp F$.
