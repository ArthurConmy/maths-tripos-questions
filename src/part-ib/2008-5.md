Describe (without proof) what it means to put an $n \times n$ matrix of complex numbers into Jordan normal form. Explain (without proof) the sense in which the Jordan normal form is unique.

Put the following matrix in Jordan normal form:

$$\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
-7 & 3 & -5 \\
7 & -1 & 5 \\
17 & -6 & 12
\end{array}\right)$$
