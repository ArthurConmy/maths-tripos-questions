Let $A$ be the abelian group generated by two elements $x, y$, subject to the relation $6 x+9 y=0$. Give a rigorous explanation of this statement by defining $A$ as an appropriate quotient of a free abelian group of rank 2. Prove that $A$ itself is not a free abelian group, and determine the exact structure of $A$.
