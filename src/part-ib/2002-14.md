Define what is meant by (i) a complete metric space, and (ii) a totally bounded metric space.

Give an example of a metric space that is complete but not totally bounded. Give an example of a metric space that is totally bounded but not complete.

Give an example of a continuous function that maps a complete metric space onto a metric space that is not complete. Give an example of a continuous function that maps a totally bounded metric space onto a metric space that is not totally bounded.

[You need not justify your examples.]
