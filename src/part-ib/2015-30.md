Let $R$ be a commutative ring. Define what it means for an ideal $I \subseteq R$ to be prime. Show that $I \subseteq R$ is prime if and only if $R / I$ is an integral domain.

Give an example of an integral domain $R$ and an ideal $I \subset R, I \neq R$, such that $R / I$ is not an integral domain.
