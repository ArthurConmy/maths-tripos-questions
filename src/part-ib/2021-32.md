Let $M$ be a module over a ring $R$ and let $S \subset M$. Define what it means that $S$ freely generates $M$. Show that this happens if and only if for every $R$-module $N$, every function $f: S \rightarrow N$ extends uniquely to a homomorphism $\phi: M \rightarrow N$.

Let $M$ be a free module over a (non-trivial) ring $R$ that is generated (not necessarily freely) by a subset $T \subset M$ of size $m$. Show that if $S$ is a basis of $M$, then $S$ is finite with $|S| \leqslant m$. Hence, or otherwise, deduce that any two bases of $M$ have the same number of elements. Denoting this number $\operatorname{rk} M$ and by quoting any result you need, show that if $R$ is a Euclidean Domain and $N$ is a submodule of $M$, then $N$ is free with $\operatorname{rk} N \leqslant \operatorname{rk} M$.

State the Primary Decomposition Theorem for a finitely generated module $M$ over a Euclidean Domain $R$. Deduce that any finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is cyclic.
