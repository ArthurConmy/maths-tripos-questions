A ball of clay of mass $m$ travels at speed $v$ in the laboratory frame towards an identical ball at rest. After colliding head-on, the balls stick together, moving in the same direction as the first ball was moving before the collision. Calculate the mass $m^{\prime}$ and speed $v^{\prime}$ of the combined lump, justifying your answers carefully.
