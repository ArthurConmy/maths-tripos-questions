Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces and $f: X \rightarrow Y$ a continuous map. Suppose $H$ is a subset of $X$ such that $f(\bar{H})$ is closed (where $\bar{H}$ denotes the closure of $H$ ). Prove that $f(\bar{H})=\overline{f(H)} .$

Give an example where $f, X, Y$ and $H$ are as above but $f(\bar{H})$ is not closed.
