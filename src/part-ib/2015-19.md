Consider a spherical bubble of radius $a$ in an inviscid fluid in the absence of gravity. The flow at infinity is at rest and the bubble undergoes translation with velocity $\mathbf{U}=U(t) \hat{\mathbf{x}}$. We assume that the flow is irrotational and derives from a potential given in spherical coordinates by

$$\phi(r, \theta)=U(t) \frac{a^{3}}{2 r^{2}} \cos \theta,$$

where $\theta$ is measured with respect to $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$. Compute the force, $\mathbf{F}$, acting on the bubble. Show that the formula for $\mathbf{F}$ can be interpreted as the acceleration force of a fraction $\alpha<1$ of the fluid displaced by the bubble, and determine the value of $\alpha$.
