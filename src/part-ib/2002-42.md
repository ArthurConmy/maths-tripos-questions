A fluid flow has velocity given in Cartesian co-ordinates as $\mathbf{u}=(k t y, 0,0)$ where $k$ is a constant and $t$ is time. Show that the flow is incompressible. Find a stream function and determine an equation for the streamlines at time $t$.

At $t=0$ the points along the straight line segment $x=0,0 \leqslant y \leqslant a, z=0$ are marked with dye. Show that at any later time the marked points continue to form a segment of a straight line. Determine the length of this line segment at time $t$ and the angle that it makes with the $x$-axis.
