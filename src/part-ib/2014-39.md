Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional real vector space, and let $T$ be an endomorphism of $V$. We say that $T$ acts on a subspace $W$ if $T(W) \subset W$.

(i) For any $x \in V$, show that $T$ acts on the linear span of $\left\{x, T(x), T^{2}(x), \ldots, T^{n-1}(x)\right\}$.

(ii) If $\left\{x, T(x), T^{2}(x), \ldots, T^{n-1}(x)\right\}$ spans $V$, show directly (i.e. without using the CayleyHamilton Theorem) that $T$ satisfies its own characteristic equation.

(iii) Suppose that $T$ acts on a subspace $W$ with $W \neq\{0\}$ and $W \neq V$. Let $e_{1}, \ldots, e_{k}$ be a basis for $W$, and extend to a basis $e_{1}, \ldots, e_{n}$ for $V$. Describe the matrix of $T$ with respect to this basis.

(iv) Using (i), (ii) and (iii) and induction, give a proof of the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem.
