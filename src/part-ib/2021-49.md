Let $P(x)$ be a solution of Legendre's equation with eigenvalue $\lambda$,

$$\left(1-x^{2}\right) \frac{d^{2} P}{d x^{2}}-2 x \frac{d P}{d x}+\lambda P=0$$

such that $P$ and its derivatives $P^{(k)}(x)=d^{k} P / d x^{k}, k=0,1,2, \ldots$, are regular at all points $x$ with $-1 \leqslant x \leqslant 1$.

(a) Show by induction that

$$\left(1-x^{2}\right) \frac{d^{2}}{d x^{2}}\left[P^{(k)}\right]-2(k+1) x \frac{d}{d x}\left[P^{(k)}\right]+\lambda_{k} P^{(k)}=0$$

for some constant $\lambda_{k}$. Find $\lambda_{k}$ explicitly and show that its value is negative when $k$ is sufficiently large, for a fixed value of $\lambda$.

(b) Write the equation for $P^{(k)}(x)$ in part (a) in self-adjoint form. Hence deduce that if $P^{(k)}(x)$ is not identically zero, then $\lambda_{k} \geqslant 0$.

[Hint: Establish a relation between integrals of the form $\int_{-1}^{1}\left[P^{(k+1)}(x)\right]^{2} f(x) d x$ and $\int_{-1}^{1}\left[P^{(k)}(x)\right]^{2} g(x) d x$ for certain functions $f(x)$ and $\left.g(x) .\right]$

(c) Use the results of parts (a) and (b) to show that if $P(x)$ is a non-zero, regular solution of Legendre's equation on $-1 \leqslant x \leqslant 1$, then $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ and $\lambda=n(n+1)$ for some integer $n=0,1,2, \ldots$
