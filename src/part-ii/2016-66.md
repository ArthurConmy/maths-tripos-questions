(a) Prove that if $K$ is a field and $f \in K[t]$, then there exists a splitting field $L$ of $f$ over $K$. [You do not need to show uniqueness of $L$.]

(b) Let $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$ be algebraically closed fields of the same characteristic. Show that either $K_{1}$ is isomorphic to a subfield of $K_{2}$ or $K_{2}$ is isomorphic to a subfield of $K_{1}$. [For subfields $F_{i}$ of $K_{1}$ and field homomorphisms $\psi_{i}: F_{i} \rightarrow K_{2}$ with $i=1$, 2, we say $\left(F_{1}, \psi_{1}\right) \leqslant\left(F_{2}, \psi_{2}\right)$ if $F_{1}$ is a subfield of $F_{2}$ and $\left.\psi_{2}\right|_{F_{1}}=\psi_{1}$. You may assume the existence of a maximal pair $(F, \psi)$ with respect to the partial order just defined.]

(c) Give an example of a finite field extension $K \subseteq L$ such that there exist $\alpha, \beta \in L \backslash K$ where $\alpha$ is separable over $K$ but $\beta$ is not separable over $K .$
