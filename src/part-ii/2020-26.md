(a) Define a register machine, a sequence of instructions for a register machine and a partial computable function. How do we encode a register machine?

(b) What is a partial recursive function? Show that a partial computable function is partial recursive. [You may assume that for a given machine with a given number of inputs, the function outputting its state in terms of the inputs and the time $t$ is recursive.]

(c) (i) Let $g: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ be the partial function defined as follows: if $n$ codes a register machine and the ensuing partial function $f_{n, 1}$ is defined at $n$, set $g(n)=f_{n, 1}(n)+1$. Otherwise set $g(n)=0$. Is $g$ a partial computable function?

(ii) Let $h: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ be the partial function defined as follows: if $n$ codes a register machine and the ensuing partial function $f_{n, 1}$ is defined at $n$, set $h(n)=f_{n, 1}(n)+1$. Otherwise, set $h(n)=0$ if $n$ is odd and let $h(n)$ be undefined if $n$ is even. Is $h$ a partial computable function?
