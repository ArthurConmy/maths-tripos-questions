(a) State Burnside's $p^{a} q^{b}$ theorem.

(b) Let $P$ be a non-trivial group of prime power order. Show that if $H$ is a non-trivial normal subgroup of $P$, then $H \cap Z(P) \neq\{1\}$.

Deduce that a non-abelian simple group cannot have an abelian subgroup of prime power index.

(c) Let $\rho$ be a representation of the finite group $G$ over $\mathbb{C}$. Show that $\delta: g \mapsto \operatorname{det}(\rho(g))$ is a linear character of $G$. Assume that $\delta(g)=-1$ for some $g \in G$. Show that $G$ has a normal subgroup of index 2 .

Now let $E$ be a group of order $2 k$, where $k$ is an odd integer. By considering the regular representation of $E$, or otherwise, show that $E$ has a normal subgroup of index $2 .$

Deduce that if $H$ is a non-abelian simple group of order less than 80 , then $H$ has order 60 .
