Explain what is meant by a steady-state bifurcation of a fixed point $\mathbf{x}_{0}(\mu)$ of an ODE $\dot{\mathbf{x}}=\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}, \mu)$, in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, where $\mu$ is a real parameter. Give examples for $n=1$ of equations exhibiting saddle-node, transcritical and pitchfork bifurcations.

Consider the system in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, with $\mu>0$,

$$\dot{x}=x\left(1-y-4 x^{2}\right), \quad \dot{y}=y\left(\mu-y-x^{2}\right) .$$

Show that the fixed point $(0, \mu)$ has a bifurcation when $\mu=1$, while the fixed points $\left(\pm \frac{1}{2}, 0\right)$ have a bifurcation when $\mu=\frac{1}{4}$. By finding the first approximation to the extended centre manifold, construct the normal form at the bifurcation point in each case, and determine the respective bifurcation types. Deduce that for $\mu$ just greater than $\frac{1}{4}$, and for $\mu$ just less than 1 , there is a stable pair of "mixed-mode" solutions with $x^{2}>0, y>0$.
