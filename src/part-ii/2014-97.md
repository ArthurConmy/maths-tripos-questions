State a result involving the discriminant of a number field that implies that the class group is finite.

Use Dedekind's theorem to factor $2,3,5$ and 7 into prime ideals in $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-34})$. By factoring $1+\sqrt{-34}$ and $4+\sqrt{-34}$, or otherwise, prove that the class group of $K$ is cyclic, and determine its order.
