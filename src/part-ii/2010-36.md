The number density for particles in thermal equilibrium, neglecting quantum effects, is

$$n=g_{s} \frac{4 \pi}{h^{3}} \int p^{2} d p \exp (-(E(p)-\mu) / k T)$$

where $g_{s}$ is the number of degrees of freedom for the particle with energy $E(p)$ and $\mu$ is its chemical potential. Evaluate $n$ for a non-relativistic particle.

Thermal equilibrium between two species of non-relativistic particles is maintained by the reaction

$$a+\alpha \leftrightarrow b+\beta$$

where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are massless particles. Evaluate the ratio of number densities $n_{a} / n_{b}$ given that their respective masses are $m_{a}$ and $m_{b}$ and chemical potentials are $\mu_{a}$ and $\mu_{b}$.

Explain how a reaction like the one above is relevant to the determination of the neutron to proton ratio in the early universe. Why does this ratio not fall rapidly to zero as the universe cools?

Explain briefly the process of primordial nucleosynthesis by which neutrons are converted into stable helium nuclei. Letting

$$Y_{H e}=\rho_{H e} / \rho$$

be the fraction of the universe's helium, compute $Y_{H e}$ as a function of the ratio $r=n_{n} / n_{p}$ at the time of nucleosynthesis.
