The particles of an Ideal Gas form a spatial Poisson process on $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with constant intensity $z>0$, called the activity of the gas.

(a) Prove that the independent mixture of two Ideal Gases with activities $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ is again an Ideal Gas. What is its activity? [You must prove any results about Poisson processes that you use. The independent mixture of two gases with particles $\Pi_{1} \subset \mathbb{R}^{3}$ and $\Pi_{2} \subset \mathbb{R}^{3}$ is given by $\left.\Pi_{1} \cup \Pi_{2} .\right]$

(b) For an Ideal Gas of activity $z>0$, find the limiting distribution of

$$\frac{N\left(V_{i}\right)-\mathbb{E} N\left(V_{i}\right)}{\sqrt{\left|V_{i}\right|}}$$

as $i \rightarrow \infty$ for a given sequence of subsets $V_{i} \subset \mathbb{R}^{3}$ with $\left|V_{i}\right| \rightarrow \infty$.

(c) Let $g: \mathbb{R}^{3} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a smooth non-negative function vanishing outside a bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Find the mean and variance of $\sum_{x} g(x)$, where the sum runs over the particles $x \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$ of an ideal gas of activity $z>0$. [You may use the properties of spatial Poisson processes established in the lectures.]

[Hint: recall that the characteristic function of a Poisson random variable with mean $\lambda$ is $\left.e^{\left(e^{i t}-1\right) \lambda} \cdot\right]$
