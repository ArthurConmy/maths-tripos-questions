Two equal masses $m$ move along a straight line between two stationary walls. The mass on the left is connected to the wall on its left by a spring of spring constant $k_{1}$, and the mass on the right is connected to the wall on its right by a spring of spring constant $k_{2}$. The two masses are connected by a third spring of spring constant $k_{3}$.

(a) Show that the Lagrangian of the system can be written in the form

$$L=\frac{1}{2} T_{i j} \dot{x}_{i} \dot{x}_{j}-\frac{1}{2} V_{i j} x_{i} x_{j}$$

where $x_{i}(t)$, for $i=1,2$, are the displacements of the two masses from their equilibrium positions, and $T_{i j}$ and $V_{i j}$ are symmetric $2 \times 2$ matrices that should be determined.

(b) Let

$$k_{1}=k(1+\epsilon \delta), \quad k_{2}=k(1-\epsilon \delta), \quad k_{3}=k \epsilon,$$

where $k>0, \epsilon>0$ and $|\epsilon \delta|<1$. Using Lagrange's equations of motion, show that the angular frequencies $\omega$ of the normal modes of the system are given by

$$\omega^{2}=\lambda \frac{k}{m}$$

where

$$\lambda=1+\epsilon\left(1 \pm \sqrt{1+\delta^{2}}\right)$$
