Let $\mathrm{U}(n)$ denote the set of $n \times n$ unitary complex matrices. Show that $\mathrm{U}(n)$ is a smooth (real) manifold, and find its dimension. [You may use any general results from the course provided they are stated correctly.] For $A$ any matrix in $\mathrm{U}(n)$ and $H$ an $n \times n$ complex matrix, determine when $H$ represents a tangent vector to $\mathrm{U}(n)$ at $A$.

Consider the tangent spaces to $\mathrm{U}(n)$ equipped with the metric induced from the standard (Euclidean) inner product $\langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle$ on the real vector space of $n \times n$ complex matrices, given by $\langle L, K\rangle=\operatorname{Re} \operatorname{trace}\left(L K^{*}\right)$, where $\operatorname{Re}$ denotes the real part and $K^{*}$ denotes the conjugate transpose of $K$. Suppose that $H$ represents a tangent vector to $\mathrm{U}(n)$ at the identity matrix $I$. Sketch an explicit construction of a geodesic curve on $\mathrm{U}(n)$ passing through $I$ and with tangent direction $H$, giving a brief proof that the acceleration of the curve is always orthogonal to the tangent space to $\mathrm{U}(n)$.

[Hint: You will find it easier to work directly with $n \times n$ complex matrices, rather than the corresponding $2 n \times 2 n$ real matrices.]
