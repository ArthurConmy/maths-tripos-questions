What is the rank of a binary linear code $C ?$ What is the weight enumeration polynomial $W_{C}$ of $C ?$

Show that $W_{C}(1,1)=2^{r}$ where $r$ is the rank of $C$. Show that $W_{C}(s, t)=W_{C}(t, s)$ for all $s$ and $t$ if and only if $W_{C}(1,0)=1$.

Find, with reasons, the weight enumeration polynomial of the repetition code of length $n$, and of the simple parity check code of length $n$.
