Define a cyclic code. Show that there is a bijection between the cyclic codes of length $n$ and the factors of $X^{n}-1$ over the field $\mathbb{F}_{2}$ of order 2 .

What is meant by saying that $\alpha$ is a primitive $n$th root of unity in a finite field extension $K$ of $\mathbb{F}_{2}$ ? What is meant by saying that $C$ is a BCH code of length $n$ with defining set $\left\{\alpha, \alpha^{2}, \ldots, \alpha^{\delta-1}\right\}$ ? Show that such a code has minimum distance at least $\delta$.

Suppose that $K$ is a finite field extension of $\mathbb{F}_{2}$ in which $X^{7}-1$ factorises into linear factors. Show that if $\beta$ is a root of $X^{3}+X^{2}+1$ then $\beta$ is a primitive 7 th root of unity and $\beta^{2}$ is also a root of $X^{3}+X^{2}+1$. Quoting any further results that you need show that the $\mathrm{BCH}$ code of length 7 with defining set $\left\{\beta, \beta^{2}\right\}$ is the Hamming code.
