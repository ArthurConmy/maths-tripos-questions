Consider the ordinary differential equation

$$y^{\prime \prime}=(|x|-E) y$$

subject to the boundary conditions $y(\pm \infty)=0$. Write down the general form of the Liouville-Green solutions for this problem for $E>0$ and show that asymptotically the eigenvalues $E_{n}, n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $E_{n}<E_{n+1}$, behave as $E_{n}=\mathrm{O}\left(n^{2 / 3}\right)$ for large $n$.
