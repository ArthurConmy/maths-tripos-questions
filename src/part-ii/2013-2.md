Let $V \subset \mathbb{P}^{3}$ be an irreducible quadric surface.

(i) Show that if $V$ is singular, then every nonsingular point lies in exactly one line in $V$, and that all the lines meet in the singular point, which is unique.

(ii) Show that if $V$ is nonsingular then each point of $V$ lies on exactly two lines of $V$.

Let $V$ be nonsingular, $P_{0}$ a point of $V$, and $\Pi \subset \mathbb{P}^{3}$ a plane not containing $P_{0}$. Show that the projection from $P_{0}$ to $\Pi$ is a birational map $f: V \rightarrow \rightarrow \Pi$. At what points does $f$ fail to be regular? At what points does $f^{-1}$ fail to be regular? Justify your answers.
