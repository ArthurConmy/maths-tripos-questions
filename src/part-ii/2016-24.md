(a) Define a recursive set and a recursively enumerable (r.e.) set. Prove that $E \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is recursive if and only if both $E$ and $\mathbb{N} \backslash E$ are r.e.

(b) Define the halting set $\mathbb{K}$. Prove that $\mathbb{K}$ is r.e. but not recursive.

(c) Let $E_{1}, E_{2}, \ldots, E_{n}$ be r.e. sets. Prove that $\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} E_{i}$ and $\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} E_{i}$ are r.e. Show by an example that the union of infinitely many r.e. sets need not be r.e.

(d) Let $E$ be a recursive set and $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ a (total) recursive function. Prove that the set $\{f(n) \mid n \in E\}$ is r.e. Is it necessarily recursive? Justify your answer.

[Any use of Church's thesis in your answer should be explicitly stated.]
