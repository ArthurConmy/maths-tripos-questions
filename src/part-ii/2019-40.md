Consider a spherically symmetric distribution of mass with density $\rho(r)$ at distance $r$ from the centre. Derive the pressure support equation that the pressure $P(r)$ has to satisfy for the system to be in static equilibrium.

Assume now that the mass density obeys $\rho(r)=A r^{2} P(r)$, for some positive constant A. Determine whether or not the system has a stable solution corresponding to a star of finite radius.
