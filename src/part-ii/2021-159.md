A semi-infinite elastic medium with shear modulus $\mu$ and shear-wave speed $c_{s}$ lies in $z \leqslant 0$. Above it, there is a layer $0 \leqslant z \leqslant h$ of a second elastic medium with shear modulus $\bar{\mu}$ and shear-wave speed $\bar{c}_{s}<c_{s}$. The top boundary is stress-free. Consider a monochromatic SH-wave propagating in the $x$-direction at speed $c$ with wavenumber $k>0$.

(a) Derive the dispersion relation

$$\tan \left[k h \sqrt{c^{2} / \bar{c}_{s}^{2}-1}\right]=\frac{\mu}{\bar{\mu}} \frac{\sqrt{1-c^{2} / c_{s}^{2}}}{\sqrt{c^{2} / \bar{c}_{s}^{2}-1}}$$

for trapped modes with no disturbance as $z \rightarrow-\infty$.

(b) Show graphically that there is always a zeroth mode, and show that the other modes have cut-off frequencies

$$\omega_{c}^{(n)}=\frac{n \pi \bar{c}_{s} c_{s}}{h \sqrt{c_{s}^{2}-\bar{c}_{s}^{2}}}$$

where $n$ is a positive integer. Sketch a graph of frequency $\omega$ against $k$ for the $n=1$ mode showing the behaviour near cut-off and for large $k$.
