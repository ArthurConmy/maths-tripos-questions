State and prove Euler's formula relating the number of vertices, edges and faces of a connected plane graph

Deduce that a planar graph of order $n \geqslant 3$ has size at most $3 n-6$. What bound can be given if the planar graph contains no triangles?

Without invoking the four colour theorem, prove that a planar graph that contains no triangles is 4-colourable.
