The Hamiltonian $H_{0}$ for a single electron atom has energy eigenstates $\left|\psi_{n}\right\rangle$ with energy eigenvalues $E_{n}$. There is an interaction with an electromagnetic wave of the form

$$H_{1}=-e \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \cos (\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}-\omega t), \quad \omega=|\mathbf{k}| c,$$

where $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ is the polarisation vector. At $t=0$ the atom is in the state $\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle$. Find a formula for the probability amplitude, to first order in $e$, to find the atom in the state $\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle$ at time $t$. If the atom has a size $a$ and $|\mathbf{k}| a \ll 1$ what are the selection rules which are relevant? For $t$ large, under what circumstances will the transition rate be approximately constant?
