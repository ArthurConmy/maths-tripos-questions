Let $q=p^{f}(f \geqslant 1)$ be a power of the prime $p$, and $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ be a finite field consisting of $q$ elements.

Let $N$ be a positive integer prime to $p$, and $\mathbb{F}_{q}\left(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{N}\right)$ be the cyclotomic extension obtained by adjoining all $N$ th roots of unity to $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. Prove that $\mathbb{F}_{q}\left(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{N}\right)$ is a finite field with $q^{n}$ elements, where $n$ is the order of the element $q \bmod N$ in the multiplicative group $(\mathbb{Z} / N \mathbb{Z})^{\times}$of the $\operatorname{ring} \mathbb{Z} / N \mathbb{Z}$.

Explain why what is proven above specialises to the following fact: the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ for an odd prime $p$ contains a square root of $-1$ if and only if $p \equiv 1(\bmod 4)$.

[Standard facts on finite fields and their extensions can be quoted without proof, as long as they are clearly stated.]
