Define the strain-rate tensor $e_{i j}$ in terms of the velocity components $u_{i}$. Write down the relation between $e_{i j}$, the pressure $p$ and the stress $\sigma_{i j}$ in an incompressible Newtonian fluid of viscosity $\mu$. Show that the local rate of stress-working $\sigma_{i j} \partial u_{i} / \partial x_{j}$ is equal to the local rate of dissipation $2 \mu e_{i j} e_{i j}$.

An incompressible fluid of density $\rho$ and viscosity $\mu$ occupies the semi-infinite region $y>0$ above a rigid plane boundary $y=0$ which oscillates with velocity $(V \cos \omega t, 0,0)$. The fluid is at rest at infinity. Determine the velocity field produced by the boundary motion after any transients have decayed.

Show that the time-averaged rate of dissipation is

$$\frac{1}{4} \sqrt{2} V^{2}(\mu \rho \omega)^{1 / 2}$$

per unit area of the boundary. Verify that this is equal to the time average of the rate of working by the boundary on the fluid per unit area.
