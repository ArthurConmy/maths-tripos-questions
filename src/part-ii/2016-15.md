(a) Define a continuous-time Markov chain $X$ with infinitesimal generator $Q$ and jump chain $Y$.

(b) Prove that if a state $x$ is transient for $Y$, then it is transient for $X$.

(c) Prove or provide a counterexample to the following: if $x$ is positive recurrent for $X$, then it is positive recurrent for $Y$.

(d) Consider the continuous-time Markov chain $\left(X_{t}\right)_{t \geqslant 0}$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ with non-zero transition rates given by

$$q(i, i+1)=2 \cdot 3^{|i|}, \quad q(i, i)=-3^{|i|+1} \quad \text { and } \quad q(i, i-1)=3^{|i|}$$

Determine whether $X$ is transient or recurrent. Let $T_{0}=\inf \left\{t \geqslant J_{1}: X_{t}=0\right\}$, where $J_{1}$ is the first jump time. Does $X$ have an invariant distribution? Justify your answer. Calculate $\mathbb{E}_{0}\left[T_{0}\right]$.

(e) Let $X$ be a continuous-time random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ with $q(x)=\|x\|^{\alpha} \wedge 1$ and $q(x, y)=q(x) /(2 d)$ for all $y \in \mathbb{Z}^{d}$ with $\|y-x\|=1$. Determine for which values of $\alpha$ the walk is transient and for which it is recurrent. In the recurrent case, determine the range of $\alpha$ for which it is also positive recurrent. [Here $\|x\|$ denotes the Euclidean norm of $x$.]
