Prove Ramsey's theorem in its usual infinite form, namely, that if $\mathbb{N}^{(r)}$ is finitely coloured then there is an infinite subset $M \subset \mathbb{N}$ such that $M^{(r)}$ is monochromatic.

Now let the graph $\mathbb{N}^{(2)}$ be coloured with an infinite number of colours in such a way that there is no infinite $M \subset \mathbb{N}$ with $M^{(2)}$ monochromatic. By considering a suitable 2-colouring of the set $\mathbb{N}^{(4)}$ of 4 -sets, show that there is an infinite $M \subset \mathbb{N}$ with the property that any two edges of $M^{(2)}$ of the form $a d, b c$ with $a<b<c<d$ have different colours.

By considering two further 2-colourings of $\mathbb{N}^{(4)}$, show that there is an infinite $M \subset \mathbb{N}$ such that any two non-incident edges of $M^{(2)}$ have different colours.
