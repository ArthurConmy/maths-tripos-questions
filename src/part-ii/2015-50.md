Consider a three-dimensional high-Reynolds number jet without swirl induced by a force $\mathbf{F}=F \mathbf{e}_{z}$ imposed at the origin in a fluid at rest. The velocity in the jet, described using cylindrical coordinates $(r, \theta, z)$, is assumed to remain steady and axisymmetric, and described by a boundary layer analysis.

(i) Explain briefly why the flow in the jet can be described by the boundary layer equations

$$u_{r} \frac{\partial u_{z}}{\partial r}+u_{z} \frac{\partial u_{z}}{\partial z}=\nu \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r \frac{\partial u_{z}}{\partial r}\right)$$

(ii) Show that the momentum flux in the jet, $F=\int_{S} \rho u_{z}^{2} d S$, where $S$ is an infinite surface perpendicular to $\mathbf{e}_{z}$, is not a function of $z$. Combining this result with scalings from the boundary layer equations, derive the scalings for the unknown width $\delta(z)$ and typical velocity $U(z)$ of the jet as functions of $z$ and the other parameters of the problem $(\rho, \nu, F)$.

(iii) Solving for the flow using a self-similar Stokes streamfunction

$$\psi(r, z)=U(z) \delta^{2}(z) f(\eta), \quad \eta=r / \delta(z)$$

show that $f(\eta)$ satisfies the differential equation

$$f f^{\prime}-\eta\left(f^{\prime 2}+f f^{\prime \prime}\right)=f^{\prime}-\eta f^{\prime \prime}+\eta^{2} f^{\prime \prime \prime} .$$

What boundary conditions should be applied to this equation? Give physical reasons for them.

[Hint: In cylindrical coordinates for axisymmetric incompressible flow $\left(u_{r}(r, z), 0, u_{z}(r, z)\right)$ you are given the incompressibility condition as

$$\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r u_{r}\right)+\frac{\partial u_{z}}{\partial z}=0$$

the $z$-component of the Navier-Stokes equation as

$$\rho\left(\frac{\partial u_{z}}{\partial t}+u_{r} \frac{\partial u_{z}}{\partial r}+u_{z} \frac{\partial u_{z}}{\partial z}\right)=-\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}+\mu\left[\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r \frac{\partial u_{z}}{\partial r}\right)+\frac{\partial^{2} u_{z}}{\partial z^{2}}\right]$$

and the relationship between the Stokes streamfunction, $\psi(r, z)$, and the velocity components as

$$\left.u_{r}=-\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial z}, \quad u_{z}=\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r}\right]$$
