(a) Consider a Lagrangian dynamical system with one degree of freedom. Write down the expression for the Hamiltonian of the system in terms of the generalized velocity $\dot{q}$, momentum $p$, and the Lagrangian $L(q, \dot{q}, t)$. By considering the differential of the Hamiltonian, or otherwise, derive Hamilton's equations.

Show that if $q$ is ignorable (cyclic) with respect to the Lagrangian, i.e. $\partial L / \partial q=0$, then it is also ignorable with respect to the Hamiltonian.

(b) A particle of charge $q$ and mass $m$ moves in the presence of electric and magnetic fields such that the scalar and vector potentials are $\phi=y E$ and $\mathbf{A}=(0, x B, 0)$, where $(x, y, z)$ are Cartesian coordinates and $E, B$ are constants. The Lagrangian of the particle is

$$L=\frac{1}{2} m \dot{\mathbf{r}}^{2}-q \phi+q \dot{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{A}$$

Starting with the Lagrangian, derive an explicit expression for the Hamiltonian and use Hamilton's equations to determine the motion of the particle.
