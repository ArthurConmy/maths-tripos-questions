(i) Let $A$ be a symmetric $n \times n$ matrix such that

$$A_{k, k}>\sum_{\substack{l=1 \\ l \neq k}}^{n}\left|A_{k, l}\right| \quad 1 \leqslant k \leqslant n .$$

Prove that it is positive definite.

(ii) Prove that both Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods for the solution of the linear system $A \mathrm{x}=\mathbf{b}$, where the matrix $A$ obeys the conditions of (i), converge.
