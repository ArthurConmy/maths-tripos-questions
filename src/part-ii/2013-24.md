(i) The action for a system with a generalized coordinate $q$ is given by

$$S=\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} L(q, \dot{q}, t) d t$$

(a) State the Principle of Least Action and derive the Euler-Lagrange equation.

(b) Consider an arbitrary function $f(q, t)$. Show that $L^{\prime}=L+d f / d t$ leads to the same equation of motion.

(ii) A wire frame $A B C$ in a shape of an equilateral triangle with side $a$ rotates in a horizontal plane with constant angular frequency $\omega$ about a vertical axis through $A$. A bead of mass $m$ is threaded on $B C$ and moves without friction. The bead is connected to $B$ and $C$ by two identical light springs of force constant $k$ and equilibrium length $a / 2$.

(a) Introducing the displacement $\eta$ of the particle from the mid point of $B C$, determine the Lagrangian $L(\eta, \dot{\eta})$.

(b) Derive the equation of motion. Identify the integral of the motion.

(c) Describe the motion of the bead. Find the condition for there to be a stable equilibrium and find the frequency of small oscillations about it when it exists.
