(a) Let $k$ be an uncountable field, $\mathcal{M} \subseteq k\left[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right]$ a maximal ideal and $A=k\left[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right] / \mathcal{M} .$

Show that every element of $A$ is algebraic over $k$.

(b) Now assume that $k$ is algebraically closed. Suppose that $J \subset k\left[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right]$ is an ideal, and that $f \in k\left[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right]$ vanishes on $Z(J)$. Using the result of part (a) or otherwise, show that $f^{N} \in J$ for some $N \geqslant 1$.

(c) Let $f: X \rightarrow Y$ be a morphism of affine algebraic varieties. Show $\overline{f(X)}=Y$ if and only if the map $f^{*}: k[Y] \rightarrow k[X]$ is injective.

Suppose now that $\overline{f(X)}=Y$, and that $X$ and $Y$ are irreducible. Define the dimension of $X, \operatorname{dim} X$, and show $\operatorname{dim} X \geqslant \operatorname{dim} Y$. [You may use whichever definition of $\operatorname{dim} X$ you find most convenient.]
