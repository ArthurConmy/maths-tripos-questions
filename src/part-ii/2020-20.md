(a) Find the leading order term of the asymptotic expansion, as $x \rightarrow \infty$, of the integral

$$I(x)=\int_{0}^{3 \pi} e^{(t+x \cos t)} d t$$

(b) Find the first two leading nonzero terms of the asymptotic expansion, as $x \rightarrow \infty$, of the integral

$$J(x)=\int_{0}^{\pi}(1-\cos t) e^{-x \ln (1+t)} d t$$
