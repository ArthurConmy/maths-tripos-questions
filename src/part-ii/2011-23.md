Derive Euler's equations governing the torque-free and force-free motion of a rigid body with principal moments of inertia $I_{1}, I_{2}$ and $I_{3}$, where $I_{1}<I_{2}<I_{3}$. Identify two constants of the motion. Hence, or otherwise, find the equilibrium configurations such that the angular-momentum vector, as measured with respect to axes fixed in the body, remains constant. Discuss the stability of these configurations.

A spacecraft may be regarded as moving in a torque-free and force-free environment. Nevertheless, flexing of various parts of the frame can cause significant dissipation of energy. How does the angular-momentum vector ultimately align itself within the body?
