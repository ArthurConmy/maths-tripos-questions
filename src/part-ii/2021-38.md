Describe the Rabin scheme for coding a message $x$ as $x^{2}$ modulo a certain integer $N$.

Describe the RSA encryption scheme with public key $(N, e)$ and private key $d$.

[In both cases you should explain how you encrypt and decrypt.]

Give an advantage and a disadvantage that the Rabin scheme has over the RSA scheme.
