(a) Show that the Stokes flow around a rigid moving sphere has the minimum viscous dissipation rate of all incompressible flows which satisfy the no-slip boundary conditions on the sphere.

(b) Let $\boldsymbol{u}=\boldsymbol{\nabla}(\boldsymbol{x} \cdot \boldsymbol{\Phi}+\chi)-2 \boldsymbol{\Phi}$, where $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ and $\chi$ are solutions of Laplace's equation, i.e. $\nabla^{2} \boldsymbol{\Phi}=\mathbf{0}$ and $\nabla^{2} \chi=0$.

(i) Show that $\boldsymbol{u}$ is incompressible.

(ii) Show that $\boldsymbol{u}$ satisfies Stokes equation if the pressure $p=2 \mu \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \boldsymbol{\Phi}$.

(c) Consider a rigid sphere moving with velocity $\boldsymbol{U}$. The Stokes flow around the sphere is given by

$$\boldsymbol{\Phi}=\alpha \frac{\boldsymbol{U}}{r} \quad \text { and } \quad \chi=\beta \boldsymbol{U} \cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla}\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)$$

where the origin is chosen to be at the centre of the sphere. Find the values for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ which ensure no-slip conditions are satisfied on the sphere.
