Briefly describe the $R S A$ public key cipher.

Just before it went into liquidation, the Internet Bank decided that it wanted to communicate with each of its customers using an RSA cipher. So, it chose a large modulus $N$, which is the product of two large prime numbers, and chose encrypting exponents $e_{j}$ and decrypting exponents $d_{j}$ for each customer $j$. The bank published $N$ and $e_{j}$ and sent the decrypting exponent $d_{j}$ secretly to customer $j$. Show explicitly that the cipher can be broken by each customer.

The bank sent out the same message to each customer. I am not a customer of the bank but have two friends who are and I notice that their published encrypting exponents are coprime. Explain how I can find the original message. Can I break the cipher?
