(a) A spherically symmetric star obeys the pressure-support equation

$$\frac{d P}{d r}=-\frac{G m \rho}{r^{2}}$$

where $P(r)$ is the pressure at a distance $r$ from the centre, $\rho(r)$ is the density, and the mass $m(r)$ is defined through the relation $d m / d r=4 \pi r^{2} \rho(r)$. Multiply $(*)$ by $4 \pi r^{3}$ and integrate over the total volume $V$ of the star to derive the virial theorem

$$\langle P\rangle V=-\frac{1}{3} E_{\text {grav }}$$

where $\langle P\rangle$ is the average pressure and $E_{\text {grav }}$ is the total gravitational potential energy.

(b) Consider a white dwarf supported by electron Fermi degeneracy pressure $P \approx h^{2} n^{5 / 3} / m_{\mathrm{e}}$, where $m_{\mathrm{e}}$ is the electron mass and $n$ is the number density. Assume a uniform density $\rho(r)=m_{\mathrm{p}} n(r) \approx m_{\mathrm{p}}\langle n\rangle$, so the total mass of the star is given by $M=(4 \pi / 3)\langle n\rangle m_{\mathrm{p}} R^{3}$ where $R$ is the star radius and $m_{\mathrm{p}}$ is the proton mass. Show that the total energy of the white dwarf can be written in the form

$$E_{\mathrm{total}}=E_{\mathrm{kin}}+E_{\mathrm{grav}}=\frac{\alpha}{R^{2}}-\frac{\beta}{R}$$

where $\alpha, \beta$ are positive constants which you should determine. [You may assume that for an ideal gas $E_{\mathrm{kin}}=\frac{3}{2}\langle P\rangle V$.] Use this expression to explain briefly why a white dwarf is stable.
