Let $f: I \rightarrow I$ be a continuous map of an interval $I \subset \mathbb{R}$. Explain what is meant by the statements (a) $f$ has a horseshoe and (b) $f$ is chaotic according to Glendinning's definition of chaos.

Assume that $f$ has a 3-cycle $\left\{x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}\right\}$ with $x_{1}=f\left(x_{0}\right), x_{2}=f\left(x_{1}\right), x_{0}=f\left(x_{2}\right)$, $x_{0}<x_{1}<x_{2}$. Prove that $f^{2}$ has a horseshoe. [You may assume the Intermediate Value Theorem.]

Represent the effect of $f$ on the intervals $I_{a}=\left[x_{0}, x_{1}\right]$ and $I_{b}=\left[x_{1}, x_{2}\right]$ by means of a directed graph. Explain how the existence of the 3 -cycle corresponds to this graph.

The map $g: I \rightarrow I$ has a 4-cycle $\left\{x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}\right\}$ with $x_{1}=g\left(x_{0}\right), x_{2}=g\left(x_{1}\right)$, $x_{3}=g\left(x_{2}\right)$ and $x_{0}=g\left(x_{3}\right)$. If $x_{0}<x_{3}<x_{2}<x_{1}$ is $g$ necessarily chaotic? [You may use a suitable directed graph as part of your argument.]

How does your answer change if $x_{0}<x_{2}<x_{1}<x_{3}$ ?
