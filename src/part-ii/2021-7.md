(a) Define the Euler characteristic of a triangulable space $X$.

(b) Let $\Sigma_{g}$ be an orientable surface of genus $g$. A $\operatorname{map} \pi: \Sigma_{g} \rightarrow S^{2}$ is a doublebranched cover if there is a set $Q=\left\{p_{1}, \ldots, p_{n}\right\} \subseteq S^{2}$ of branch points, such that the restriction $\pi: \Sigma_{g} \backslash \pi^{-1}(Q) \rightarrow S^{2} \backslash Q$ is a covering map of degree 2 , but for each $p \in Q$, $\pi^{-1}(p)$ consists of one point. By carefully choosing a triangulation of $S^{2}$, use the Euler characteristic to find a formula relating $g$ and $n$.
