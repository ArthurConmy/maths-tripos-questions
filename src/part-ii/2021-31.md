The Lagrangian of a particle of mass $m$ and charge $q$ in an electromagnetic field takes the form

$$L=\frac{1}{2} m|\dot{\mathbf{r}}|^{2}+q(-\phi+\dot{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{A})$$

Explain the meaning of $\phi$ and $\mathbf{A}$, and how they are related to the electric and magnetic fields.

Obtain the canonical momentum $\mathbf{p}$ and the Hamiltonian $H(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{p}, t)$.

Suppose that the electric and magnetic fields have Cartesian components $(E, 0,0)$ and $(0,0, B)$, respectively, where $E$ and $B$ are positive constants. Explain why the Hamiltonian of the particle can be taken to be

$$H=\frac{p_{x}^{2}}{2 m}+\frac{\left(p_{y}-q B x\right)^{2}}{2 m}+\frac{p_{z}^{2}}{2 m}-q E x$$

State three independent integrals of motion in this case.
