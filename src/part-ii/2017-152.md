Derive the wave equation governing the pressure disturbance $\tilde{p}$, for linearised, constant entropy sound waves in a compressible inviscid fluid of density $\rho_{0}$ and sound speed $c_{0}$, which is otherwise at rest.

Consider a harmonic acoustic plane wave with wavevector $\mathbf{k}_{I}=k_{I}(\sin \theta, \cos \theta, 0)$ and unit-amplitude pressure disturbance. Determine the resulting velocity field $\mathbf{u}$.

Consider such an acoustic wave incident from $y<0$ on a thin elastic plate at $y=0$. The regions $y<0$ and $y>0$ are occupied by gases with densities $\rho_{1}$ and $\rho_{2}$, respectively, and sound speeds $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$, respectively. The kinematic boundary conditions at the plate are those appropriate for an inviscid fluid, and the (linearised) dynamic boundary condition is

$$m \frac{\partial^{2} \eta}{\partial t^{2}}+B \frac{\partial^{4} \eta}{\partial x^{4}}+[\tilde{p}(x, 0, t)]_{-}^{+}=0$$

where $m$ and $B$ are the mass and bending moment per unit area of the plate, and $y=\eta(x, t)$ (with $\left|\mathbf{k}_{I} \eta\right| \ll 1$ ) is its perturbed position. Find the amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted pressure perturbations, expressing your answers in terms of the dimensionless parameter

$$\beta=\frac{k_{I} \cos \theta\left(m c_{1}^{2}-B k_{I}^{2} \sin ^{4} \theta\right)}{\rho_{1} c_{1}^{2}}$$

(i) If $\rho_{1}=\rho_{2}=\rho_{0}$ and $c_{1}=c_{2}=c_{0}$, under what condition is the incident wave perfectly transmitted?

(ii) If $\rho_{1} c_{1} \gg \rho_{2} c_{2}$, comment on the reflection coefficient, and show that waves incident at a sufficiently large angle are reflected as if from a pressure-release surface (i.e. an interface where $\tilde{p}=0$ ), no matter how large the plate mass and bending moment may be.
