The data frame Ambulance contains data on the number of ambulance requests from a Cambridgeshire hospital on different days. In addition to the number of ambulance requests on each day, the dataset records whether each day fell in the winter season, on a weekend, or on a bank holiday, as well as the pollution level on each day.

A health researcher fitted two models to the dataset above using $R$. Consider the following code and its output.

Define the two models fitted by this code and perform a hypothesis test with level $1 \%$ in which one of the models is the null hypothesis and the other is the alternative. State the theorem used in this hypothesis test. You may use the information generated by the following commands.
