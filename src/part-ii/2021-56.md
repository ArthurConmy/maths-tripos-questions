(a) Derive the Larmor formula for the total power $P$ emitted through a large sphere of radius $R$ by a non-relativistic particle of mass $m$ and charge $q$ with trajectory $\mathbf{x}(t)$. You may assume that the electric and magnetic fields describing radiation due to a source localised near the origin with electric dipole moment $\mathbf{p}(t)$ can be approximated as

$$\begin{aligned}
&\mathbf{B}_{\operatorname{Rad}}(\mathbf{x}, t)=-\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi r c} \widehat{\mathbf{x}} \times \ddot{\mathbf{p}}(t-r / c) \\
&\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{Rad}}(\mathbf{x}, t)=-c \widehat{\mathbf{x}} \times \mathbf{B}_{\operatorname{Rad}}(\mathbf{x}, t)
\end{aligned}$$

Here, the radial distance $r=|\mathbf{x}|$ is assumed to be much larger than the wavelength of emitted radiation which, in turn, is large compared to the spatial extent of the source.

(b) A non-relativistic particle of mass $m$, moving at speed $v$ along the $x$-axis in the positive direction, encounters a step potential of width $L$ and height $V_{0}>0$ described by

$$V(x)= \begin{cases}0, & x<0 \\ f(x), & 0 \leqslant x \leqslant L \\ V_{0}, & x>L\end{cases}$$

where $f(x)$ is a monotonically increasing function with $f(0)=0$ and $f(L)=V_{0}$. The particle carries charge $q$ and loses energy by emitting electromagnetic radiation. Assume that the total energy loss through emission $\Delta E_{\text {Rad }}$ is negligible compared with the particle's initial kinetic energy $E=m v^{2} / 2$. For $E>V_{0}$, show that the total energy lost is

$$\Delta E_{\mathrm{Rad}}=\frac{q^{2} \mu_{0}}{6 \pi m^{2} c} \sqrt{\frac{m}{2}} \int_{0}^{L} d x \frac{1}{\sqrt{E-f(x)}}\left(\frac{d f}{d x}\right)^{2}$$

Find the total energy lost also for the case $E<V_{0}$.

(c) Take $f(x)=V_{0} x / L$ and explicitly evaluate the particle energy loss $\Delta E_{\text {Rad }}$ in each of the cases $E>V_{0}$ and $E<V_{0}$. What is the maximum value attained by $\Delta E_{\text {Rad }}$ as $E$ is varied?
