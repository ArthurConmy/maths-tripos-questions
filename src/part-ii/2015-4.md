Let $K$ and $L$ be simplicial complexes. Explain what is meant by a simplicial approximation to a continuous map $f:|K| \rightarrow|L|$. State the simplicial approximation theorem, and define the homomorphism induced on homology by a continuous map between triangulable spaces. [You do not need to show that the homomorphism is welldefined.]

Let $h: S^{1} \rightarrow S^{1}$ be given by $z \mapsto z^{n}$ for a positive integer $n$, where $S^{1}$ is considered as the unit complex numbers. Compute the map induced by $h$ on homology.
