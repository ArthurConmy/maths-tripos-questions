(a) Let $K$ be a topological space and let $C_{\mathbb{R}}(K)$ denote the normed vector space of bounded continuous real-valued functions on $K$ with the norm $\|f\|_{C_{\mathbb{R}}(K)}=\sup _{x \in K}|f(x)|$. Define the terms uniformly bounded, equicontinuous and relatively compact as applied to subsets $S \subset C_{\mathbb{R}}(K)$.

(b) The Arzela-Ascoli theorem [which you need not prove] states in particular that if $K$ is compact and $S \subset C_{\mathbb{R}}(K)$ is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous, then $S$ is relatively compact. Show by examples that each of the compactness of $K$, uniform boundedness of $S$, and equicontinuity of $S$ are necessary conditions for this conclusion.

(c) Let $L$ be a topological space. Assume that there exists a sequence of compact subsets $K_{n}$ of $L$ such that $K_{1} \subset K_{2} \subset K_{3} \subset \cdots \subset L$ and $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} K_{n}=L$. Suppose $S \subset C_{\mathbb{R}}(L)$ is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous and moreover satisfies the condition that, for every $\epsilon>0$, there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $|f(x)|<\epsilon$ for every $x \in L \backslash K_{n}$ and for every $f \in S$. Show that $S$ is relatively compact.
