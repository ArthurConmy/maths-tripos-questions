What is the discrete logarithm problem?

Describe the Diffie-Hellman key exchange system for two people. What is the connection with the discrete logarithm problem? Why might one use this scheme rather than just a public key system or a classical (pre-1960) coding system?

Extend the Diffie-Hellman system to $n$ people using $n(n-1)$ transmitted numbers.
