Suppose $\alpha>0$. Define what it means to say that

$$F(x) \sim \frac{1}{\alpha x} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} n !\left(\frac{-1}{\alpha x}\right)^{n}$$

is an asymptotic expansion of $F(x)$ as $x \rightarrow \infty$. Show that $F(x)$ has no other asymptotic expansion in inverse powers of $x$ as $x \rightarrow \infty$.

To estimate the value of $F(x)$ for large $x$, one may use an optimal truncation of the asymptotic expansion. Explain what is meant by this, and show that the error is an exponentially small quantity in $x$.

Derive an integral respresentation for a function $F(x)$ with the above asymptotic expansion.
