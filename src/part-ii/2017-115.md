The Hamiltonian for a quantum system in the SchrÃ¶dinger picture is

$$H_{0}+\lambda V(t),$$

where $H_{0}$ is independent of time and the parameter $\lambda$ is small. Define the interaction picture corresponding to this Hamiltonian and derive a time evolution equation for interaction picture states.

Let $|n\rangle$ and $|m\rangle$ be eigenstates of $H_{0}$ with distinct eigenvalues $E_{n}$ and $E_{m}$ respectively. Show that if the system was in the state $|n\rangle$ in the remote past, then the probability of measuring it to be in a different state $|m\rangle$ at a time $t$ is

$$\frac{\lambda^{2}}{\hbar^{2}}\left|\int_{-\infty}^{t} d t^{\prime}\left\langle m\left|V\left(t^{\prime}\right)\right| n\right\rangle e^{i\left(E_{m}-E_{n}\right) t^{\prime} / \hbar}\right|^{2}+O\left(\lambda^{3}\right)$$

Let the system be a simple harmonic oscillator with $H_{0}=\hbar \omega\left(a^{\dagger} a+\frac{1}{2}\right)$, where $\left[a, a^{\dagger}\right]=1$. Let $|0\rangle$ be the ground state which obeys $a|0\rangle=0$. Suppose

$$V(t)=e^{-p|t|}\left(a+a^{\dagger}\right),$$

with $p>0$. In the remote past the system was in the ground state. Find the probability, to lowest non-trivial order in $\lambda$, for the system to be in the first excited state in the far future.
