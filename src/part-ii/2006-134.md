Two examples of phenomenological temperature measurements are (i) the mark reached along the length of a liquid-in-glass thermometer; and (ii) the wavelength of the brightest colour of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a hot body (used, for example, to measure the surface temperature of a star).

Give the definition of temperature in statistical physics, and explain how the analysis of ideal gases and black body radiation is used to calibrate and improve phenomenological temperature measurements like those mentioned above. You should give brief derivations of any key results that you use.
