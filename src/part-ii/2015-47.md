Briefly explain how to interpret the components of the relativistic stress-energy tensor in terms of the density and flux of energy and momentum in some inertial frame.

(i) The stress-energy tensor of the electromagnetic field is

$$T_{\mathrm{em}}^{\mu \nu}=\frac{1}{\mu_{0}}\left(F^{\mu \alpha} F_{\alpha}^{\nu}-\frac{1}{4} \eta^{\mu \nu} F^{\alpha \beta} F_{\alpha \beta}\right)$$

where $F_{\mu \nu}$ is the field strength, $\eta_{\mu \nu}$ is the Minkowski metric, and $\mu_{0}$ is the permeability of free space. Show that $\partial_{\mu} T_{\mathrm{em}}^{\mu \nu}=-F_{\mu}^{\nu} J^{\mu}$, where $J^{\mu}$ is the current 4-vector.

[ Maxwell's equations are $\partial_{\mu} F^{\mu \nu}=-\mu_{0} J^{\nu}$ and $\partial_{\rho} F_{\mu \nu}+\partial_{\nu} F_{\rho \mu}+\partial_{\mu} F_{\nu \rho}=0 .$ ]

(ii) A fluid consists of point particles of rest mass $m$ and charge $q$. The fluid can be regarded as a continuum, with 4 -velocity $u^{\mu}(x)$ depending on the position $x$ in spacetime. For each $x$ there is an inertial frame $S_{x}$ in which the fluid particles at $x$ are at rest. By considering components in $S_{x}$, show that the fluid has a current 4-vector field

$$J^{\mu}=q n_{0} u^{\mu}$$

and a stress-energy tensor

$$T_{\text {fluid }}^{\mu \nu}=m n_{0} u^{\mu} u^{\nu},$$

where $n_{0}(x)$ is the proper number density of particles (the number of particles per unit spatial volume in $S_{x}$ in a small region around $x$ ). Write down the Lorentz 4-force on a fluid particle at $x$. By considering the resulting 4 -acceleration of the fluid, show that the total stress-energy tensor is conserved, i.e.

$$\partial_{\mu}\left(T_{\mathrm{em}}^{\mu \nu}+T_{\text {fluid }}^{\mu \nu}\right)=0 .$$
