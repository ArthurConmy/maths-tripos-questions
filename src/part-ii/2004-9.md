(i) What is a linear code? What does it mean to say that a linear code has length $n$ and minimum weight $d$ ? When is a linear code perfect? Show that, if $n=2^{r}-1$, there exists a perfect linear code of length $n$ and minimum weight 3 .

(ii) Describe the construction of a Reed-Muller code. Establish its information rate and minimum weight.
