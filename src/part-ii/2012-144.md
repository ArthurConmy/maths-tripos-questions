Consider a multi-period binomial model with a risky asset $\left(S_{0}, \ldots, S_{T}\right)$ and a riskless asset $\left(B_{0}, \ldots, B_{T}\right)$. In each period, the value of the risky asset $S$ is multiplied by $u$ if the period was good, and by $d$ otherwise. The riskless asset is worth $B_{t}=(1+r)^{t}$ at time $0 \leqslant t \leqslant T$, where $r \geqslant 0$.

(i) Assuming that $T=1$ and that

$$d<1+r<u$$

show how any contingent claim to be paid at time 1 can be priced and exactly replicated. Briefly explain the significance of the condition (1), and indicate how the analysis of the single-period model extends to many periods.

(ii) Now suppose that $T=2$. We assume that $u=2, d=1 / 3, r=1 / 2$, and that the risky asset is worth $S_{0}=27$ at time zero. Find the time- 0 value of an American put option with strike price $K=28$ and expiry at time $T=2$, and find the optimal exercise policy. (Assume that the option cannot be exercised immediately at time zero.)
