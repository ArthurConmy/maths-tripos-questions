Write an essay on boundary-layer theory and its application to the generation of lift in aerodynamics.

You should include discussion of the derivation of the boundary-layer equation, the similarity transformation leading to the Falkner-Skan equation, the influence of an adverse pressure gradient, and the mechanism(s) by which circulation is generated in flow past bodies with a sharp trailing edge.
