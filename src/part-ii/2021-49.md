Let $X$ and $Y$ be smooth boundaryless manifolds. Suppose $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is a smooth map. What does it mean for $y \in Y$ to be a regular value of $f$ ? State Sard's theorem and the stack-of-records theorem.

Suppose $g: X \rightarrow Y$ is another smooth map. What does it mean for $f$ and $g$ to be smoothly homotopic? Assume now that $X$ is compact, and has the same dimension as $Y$. Suppose that $y \in Y$ is a regular value for both $X$ and $Y$. Prove that

$$\# f^{-1}(y)=\# g^{-1}(y)(\bmod 2)$$

Let $U \subset S^{n}$ be a non-empty open subset of the sphere. Suppose that $h: S^{n} \rightarrow S^{n}$ is a smooth map such that $\# h^{-1}(y)=1(\bmod 2)$ for all $y \in U$. Show that there must exist a pair of antipodal points on $S^{n}$ which is mapped to another pair of antipodal points by $h$.

[You may assume results about compact 1-manifolds provided they are accurately stated.]
