A particle of mass $m$ moves in three dimensions subject to a potential $V(\mathbf{r})$ localised near the origin. The wavefunction for a scattering process with incident particle of wavevector $\mathbf{k}$ is denoted $\psi(\mathbf{k}, \mathbf{r})$. With reference to the asymptotic form of $\psi$, define the scattering amplitude $f\left(\mathbf{k}, \mathbf{k}^{\prime}\right)$, where $\mathbf{k}^{\prime}$ is the wavevector of the outgoing particle with $\left|\mathbf{k}^{\prime}\right|=|\mathbf{k}|=k$.

By recasting the Schr√∂dinger equation for $\psi(\mathbf{k}, \mathbf{r})$ as an integral equation, show that

$$f\left(\mathbf{k}, \mathbf{k}^{\prime}\right)=-\frac{m}{2 \pi \hbar^{2}} \int d^{3} \mathbf{r}^{\prime} \exp \left(-i \mathbf{k}^{\prime} \cdot \mathbf{r}^{\prime}\right) V\left(\mathbf{r}^{\prime}\right) \psi\left(\mathbf{k}, \mathbf{r}^{\prime}\right)$$

[You may assume that

$$\mathcal{G}(k ; \mathbf{r})=-\frac{1}{4 \pi|\mathbf{r}|} \exp (i k|\mathbf{r}|)$$

is the Green's function for $\nabla^{2}+k^{2}$ which obeys the appropriate boundary conditions for a scattering solution.]

Now suppose $V(\mathbf{r})=\lambda U(\mathbf{r})$, where $\lambda \ll 1$ is a dimensionless constant. Determine the first two non-zero terms in the expansion of $f\left(\mathbf{k}, \mathbf{k}^{\prime}\right)$ in powers of $\lambda$, giving each term explicitly as an integral over one or more position variables $\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r}^{\prime}, \ldots$

Evaluate the contribution to $f\left(\mathbf{k}, \mathbf{k}^{\prime}\right)$ of order $\lambda$ in the case $U(\mathbf{r})=\delta(|\mathbf{r}|-a)$, expressing the answer as a function of $a, k$ and the scattering angle $\theta$ (defined so that $\left.\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{k}^{\prime}=k^{2} \cos \theta\right)$.
