Let $(E, \mathcal{E}, \mu)$ be a measure space. A function $f$ is simple if it is of the form $f=\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_{i} 1_{A_{i}}$, where $a_{i} \in \mathbb{R}, N \in \mathbb{N}$ and $A_{i} \in \mathcal{E}$.

Now let $f:(E, \mathcal{E}, \mu) \rightarrow[0, \infty]$ be a Borel-measurable map. Show that there exists a sequence $f_{n}$ of simple functions such that $f_{n}(x) \rightarrow f(x)$ for all $x \in E$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.

Next suppose $f$ is also $\mu$-integrable. Construct a sequence $f_{n}$ of simple $\mu$-integrable functions such that $\int_{E}\left|f_{n}-f\right| d \mu \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.

Finally, suppose $f$ is also bounded. Show that there exists a sequence $f_{n}$ of simple functions such that $f_{n} \rightarrow f$ uniformly on $E$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.
