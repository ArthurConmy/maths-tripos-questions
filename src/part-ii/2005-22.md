Define a cyclic code. Define the generator and check polynomials of a cyclic code and show that they exist.

Show that Hamming's original code is a cyclic code with check polynomial $X^{4}+X^{2}+X+1$. What is its generator polynomial? Does Hamming's original code contain a subcode equivalent to its dual?
