Define what is meant by the geodesic curvature $k_{g}$ of a regular curve $\alpha: I \rightarrow S$ parametrized by arc length on a smooth oriented surface $S \subset \mathbf{R}^{3}$. If $S$ is the unit sphere in $\mathbf{R}^{3}$ and $\alpha: I \rightarrow S$ is a parametrized geodesic circle of radius $\phi$, with $0<\phi<\pi / 2$, justify the fact that $\left|k_{g}\right|=\cot \phi$.

State the general form of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem with boundary on an oriented surface $S$, explaining briefly the terms which occur.

Let $S \subset \mathbf{R}^{3}$ now denote the circular cone given by $z>0$ and $x^{2}+y^{2}=z^{2} \tan ^{2} \phi$, for a fixed choice of $\phi$ with $0<\phi<\pi / 2$, and with a fixed choice of orientation. Let $\alpha: I \rightarrow S$ be a simple closed piecewise regular curve on $S$, with (signed) exterior angles $\theta_{1}, \ldots, \theta_{N}$ at the vertices (that is, $\theta_{i}$ is the angle between limits of tangent directions, with sign determined by the orientation). Suppose furthermore that the smooth segments of $\alpha$ are geodesic curves. What possible values can $\theta_{1}+\cdots+\theta_{N}$ take? Justify your answer.

[You may assume that a simple closed curve in $\mathbf{R}^{2}$ bounds a region which is homeomorphic to a disc. Given another simple closed curve in the interior of this region, you may assume that the two curves bound a region which is homeomorphic to an annulus.]
