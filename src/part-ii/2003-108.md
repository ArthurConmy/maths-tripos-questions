(a) For which polynomials $f(x)$ of degree $d>0$ does the equation $y^{2}=f(x)$ define a smooth affine curve?

(b) Now let $C$ be the completion of the curve defined in (a) to a projective curve. For which polynomials $f(x)$ of degree $d>0$ is $C$ a smooth projective curve?

(c) Suppose that $C$, defined in (b), is a smooth projective curve. Consider a map $p: C \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^{1}$, given by $p(x, y)=x$. Find the degree and the ramification points of $p$.
