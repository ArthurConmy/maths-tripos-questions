(a) Show that every irreducible complex representation of an abelian group is onedimensional.

(b) Show, by example, that the analogue of (a) fails for real representations.

(c) Let the cyclic group of order $n$ act on $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ by cyclic permutation of the standard basis vectors. Decompose this representation explicitly into irreducibles.
