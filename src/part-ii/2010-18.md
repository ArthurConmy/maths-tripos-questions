(a) Consider for $\lambda>0$ the Laplace type integral

$$I(\lambda)=\int_{a}^{b} f(t) \mathrm{e}^{-\lambda \phi(t)} d t$$

for some finite $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and smooth, real-valued functions $f(t), \phi(t)$. Assume that the function $\phi(t)$ has a single minimum at $t=c$ with $a<c<b$. Give an account of Laplace's method for finding the leading order asymptotic behaviour of $I(\lambda)$ as $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$ and briefly discuss the difference if instead $c=a$ or $c=b$, i.e. when the minimum is attained at the boundary.

(b) Determine the leading order asymptotic behaviour of

$$I(\lambda)=\int_{-2}^{1} \cos t \mathrm{e}^{-\lambda t^{2}} d t$$

as $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$

(c) Determine also the leading order asymptotic behaviour when cos $t$ is replaced by $\sin t$ in $(*)$.
