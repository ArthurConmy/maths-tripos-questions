Write down the character table of $D_{10}$.

Suppose that $G$ is a group of order 60 containing 24 elements of order 5,20 elements of order 3 and 15 elements of order 2 . Calculate the character table of $G$, justifying your answer.

[You may assume the formula for induction of characters, provided you state it clearly.]
