Consider the following metric for a 3-dimensional, static and rotationally symmetric Lorentzian manifold:

$$d s^{2}=r^{-2}\left(-d t^{2}+d r^{2}\right)+r^{2} d \theta^{2}$$

(a) Write down a Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}$ for arbitrary geodesics in this metric, if the geodesic is affinely parameterized with respect to $\lambda$. What condition may be imposed to distinguish spacelike, timelike, and null geodesics?

(b) Find the three constants of motion for any geodesic.

(c) Two observation stations are sitting at radii $r=R$ and $r=2 R$ respectively, and at the same angular coordinate. Each is accelerating so as to remain stationary with respect to time translations. At $t=0$ a photon is emitted from the naked singularity at $r=0$.

(i) At what time $t_{1}$ does the photon reach the inner station?

(ii) Express the frequency $\nu_{2}$ of the photon at the outer station in terms of the frequency $\nu_{1}$ at the inner station. Explain whether the photon is redshifted or blueshifted as it travels.

(d) Consider a complete (i.e. infinite in both directions) spacelike geodesic on a constant- $t$ slice with impact parameter $b=r_{\min }>0$. What is the angle $\Delta \theta$ between the two asymptotes of the geodesic at $r=\infty$ ? [You need not be concerned with the sign of $\Delta \theta$ or the periodicity of the $\theta$ coordinate.]

[Hint: You may find integration by substitution useful.]
