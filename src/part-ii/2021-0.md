Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field and let $V \subset \mathbb{A}_{k}^{n}$ be a non-empty affine variety. Show that $V$ is a finite union of irreducible subvarieties.

Let $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ be subvarieties of $\mathbb{A}_{k}^{n}$ given by the vanishing loci of ideals $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ respectively. Prove the following assertions.

(i) The variety $V_{1} \cap V_{2}$ is equal to the vanishing locus of the ideal $I_{1}+I_{2}$.

(ii) The variety $V_{1} \cup V_{2}$ is equal to the vanishing locus of the ideal $I_{1} \cap I_{2}$.

Decompose the vanishing locus

$$\mathbb{V}\left(X^{2}+Y^{2}-1, X^{2}-Z^{2}-1\right) \subset \mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{C}}^{3}$$

into irreducible components.

Let $V \subset \mathbb{A}_{k}^{3}$ be the union of the three coordinate axes. Let $W$ be the union of three distinct lines through the point $(0,0)$ in $\mathbb{A}_{k}^{2}$. Prove that $W$ is not isomorphic to $V$.
