(i) What does it mean to say that $\left(X_{n}, \mathcal{F}_{n}\right)_{n \geqslant 0}$ is a martingale?

(ii) If $Y$ is an integrable random variable and $Y_{n}=E\left[Y \mid \mathcal{F}_{n}\right]$, prove that $\left(Y_{n}, \mathcal{F}_{n}\right)$ is a martingale. [Standard facts about conditional expectation may be used without proof provided they are clearly stated.] When is it the case that the limit $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} Y_{n}$ exists almost surely?

(iii) An urn contains initially one red ball and one blue ball. A ball is drawn at random and then returned to the urn with a new ball of the other colour. This process is repeated, adding one ball at each stage to the urn. If the number of red balls after $n$ draws and replacements is $X_{n}$, and the number of blue balls is $Y_{n}$, show that $M_{n}=h\left(X_{n}, Y_{n}\right)$ is a martingale, where

$$h(x, y)=(x-y)(x+y-1)$$

Does this martingale converge almost surely?
