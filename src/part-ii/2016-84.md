State the Completeness Theorem for the first-order predicate calculus, and deduce the Compactness Theorem.

Let $\mathbb{T}$ be a first-order theory over a signature $\Sigma$ whose axioms all have the form $(\forall \vec{x}) \phi$ where $\vec{x}$ is a (possibly empty) string of variables and $\phi$ is quantifier-free. Show that every substructure of a $\mathbb{T}$-model is a $\mathbb{T}$-model, and deduce that if $\mathbb{T}$ is consistent then it has a model in which every element is the interpretation of a closed term of $\mathcal{L}(\Sigma)$. $[$ You may assume the result that if $B$ is a substructure of $A$ and $\phi$ is a quantifier-free formula with $n$ free variables, then $\llbracket \phi \rrbracket_{B}=\llbracket \phi \rrbracket_{A} \cap B^{n}$.]

Now suppose $\mathbb{T} \vdash(\exists x) \psi$ where $\psi$ is a quantifier-free formula with one free variable $x$. Show that there is a finite list $\left(t_{1}, t_{2}, \ldots, t_{n}\right)$ of closed terms of $\mathcal{L}(\Sigma)$ such that

$$\mathbb{T} \vdash\left(\psi\left[t_{1} / x\right] \vee \psi\left[t_{2} / x\right] \vee \cdots \vee \psi\left[t_{n} / x\right]\right)$$
