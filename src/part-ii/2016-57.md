State the vorticity equation and interpret the meaning of each term.

A planar vortex sheet is diffusing in the presence of a perpendicular straining flow. The flow is everywhere of the form $\mathbf{u}=(U(y, t),-E y, E z)$, where $U \rightarrow \pm U_{0}$ as $y \rightarrow \pm \infty$, and $U_{0}$ and $E>0$ are constants. Show that the vorticity has the form $\boldsymbol{\omega}=\omega(y, t) \mathbf{e}_{z}$, and obtain a scalar equation describing the evolution of $\omega$.

Explain physically why the solution approaches a steady state in which the vorticity is concentrated near $y=0$. Use scaling to estimate the thickness $\delta$ of the steady vorticity layer as a function of $E$ and the kinematic viscosity $\nu$.

Determine the steady vorticity profile, $\omega(y)$, and the steady velocity profile, $U(y)$.

$\left[\right.$ Hint: $\left.\quad \operatorname{erf}(x)=\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{0}^{x} e^{-u^{2}} \mathrm{~d} u .\right]$

State, with a brief physical justification, why you might expect this steady flow to be unstable to long-wavelength perturbations, defining what you mean by long.
