Find all the singular points of the differential equation

$$z \frac{d^{2} y}{d z^{2}}+(2-z) \frac{d y}{d z}-y=0$$

and determine whether they are regular or irregular singular points.

By writing $y(z)=f(z) / z$, find two linearly independent solutions to this equation.

Comment on the relationship of your solutions to the nature of the singular points of the original differential equation.
