Define the 'pull-back' homomorphism of differential forms determined by the smooth map $f: M \rightarrow N$ and state its main properties.

If $\theta: W \rightarrow V$ is a diffeomorphism between open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ with coordinates $x_{i}$ on $V$ and $y_{j}$ on $W$ and the $m$-form $\omega$ is equal to $f d x_{1} \wedge \ldots \wedge d x_{m}$ on $V$, state and prove the expression for $\theta^{*}(\omega)$ as a multiple of $d y_{1} \wedge \ldots \wedge d y_{m}$.

Define the integral of an $m$-form $\omega$ over an oriented $m$-manifold $M$ and prove that it is well-defined.

Show that the inclusion map $f: N \hookrightarrow M$, of an oriented $n$-submanifold $N$ (without boundary) into $M$, determines an element $\nu$ of $H_{n}(M) \cong \operatorname{Hom}\left(H^{n}(M), \mathbb{R}\right)$. If $M=N \times P$ and $f(x)=(x, p)$, for $x \in N$ and $p$ fixed in $P$, what is the relation between $\nu$ and $\pi^{*}\left(\left[\omega_{N}\right]\right)$, where $\left[\omega_{N}\right]$ is the fundamental cohomology class of $N$ and $\pi$ is the projection onto the first factor?
