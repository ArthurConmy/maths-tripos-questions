State the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

Find all solutions to the simultaneous congruences

$$\begin{aligned}
&x \equiv 2 \quad(\bmod 3) \\
&x \equiv 3(\bmod 5) \\
&x \equiv 5(\bmod 7)
\end{aligned}$$

A positive integer is said to be square-free if it is the product of distinct primes. Show that there are 100 consecutive numbers that are not square-free.
