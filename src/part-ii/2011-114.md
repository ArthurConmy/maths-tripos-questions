Two individual angular momentum states $\left|j_{1}, m_{1}\right\rangle,\left|j_{2}, m_{2}\right\rangle$, acted on by $\mathbf{J}^{(1)}$ and $\mathbf{J}^{(2)}$ respectively, can be combined to form a combined state $|J, M\rangle$. What is the combined angular momentum operator $\mathbf{J}$ in terms of $\mathbf{J}^{(1)}$ and $\mathbf{J}^{(2)}$ ? [Units in which $\hbar=1$ are to be used throughout.]

Defining raising and lowering operators $J_{\pm}^{(i)}$, where $i \in\{1,2\}$, find an expression for $\mathbf{J}^{2}$ in terms of $\mathbf{J}^{(i)^{2}}, J_{\pm}^{(i)}$ and $J_{3}^{(i)}$. Show that this implies

$$\left[\mathbf{J}^{2}, J_{3}\right]=0$$

Write down the state with $J=j_{1}+j_{2}$ and with $J_{3}$ eigenvalue $M=-j_{1}-j_{2}$ in terms of the individual angular momentum states. From this starting point, calculate the combined state with eigenvalues $J=j_{1}+j_{2}-1$ and $M=-j_{1}-j_{2}+1$ in terms of the individual angular momentum states.

If $j_{1}=3$ and $j_{2}=1$ and the combined system is in the state $|3,-3\rangle$, what is the probability of measuring the $J_{3}^{(i)}$ eigenvalues of individual angular momentum states to be $-3$ and 0 , respectively?

[You may assume without proof that standard angular momentum states $|j, m\rangle$ are joint eigenstates of $\mathbf{J}^{2}$ and $J_{3}$, obeying

$$J_{\pm}|j, m\rangle=\sqrt{(j \mp m)(j \pm m+1)}|j, m+1\rangle,$$

and that

$$\left.\left[J_{\pm}, J_{3}\right]=\pm J_{\pm} \cdot\right]$$
