Define the bar product $C_{1} \mid C_{2}$ of binary linear codes $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$, where $C_{2}$ is a subcode of $C_{1}$. Relate the rank and minimum distance of $C_{1} \mid C_{2}$ to those of $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ and justify your answer. Show that if $C^{\perp}$ denotes the dual code of $C$, then

$$\left(C_{1} \mid C_{2}\right)^{\perp}=C_{2}^{\perp} \mid C_{1}^{\perp}$$

Using the bar product construction, or otherwise, define the Reed-Muller code $\mathrm{RM}(d, r)$ for $0 \leqslant r \leqslant d$. Show that if $0 \leqslant r \leqslant d-1$, then the dual of $\mathrm{RM}(d, r)$ is again a Reed-Muller code.
