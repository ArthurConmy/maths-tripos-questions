Write an essay on Strong Lagrangian problems. You should give an account of duality and how it relates to the Strong Lagrangian property. In particular, establish carefully the relationship between the Strong Lagrangian property and supporting hyperplanes.

Also, give an example of a class of problems that are Strong Lagrangian. [You should explain carefully why your example has the Strong Lagrangian property.]
