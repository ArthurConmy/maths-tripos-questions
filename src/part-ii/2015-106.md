(a) State the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem, and explain for which values of $a \in \mathbb{R}$ it implies the existence of solutions to the Cauchy problem

$$x u_{x}+y u_{y}+a u_{z}=u, \quad u(x, y, 0)=f(x, y),$$

where $f$ is real analytic. Using the method of characteristics, solve this problem for these values of $a$, and comment on the behaviour of the characteristics as $a$ approaches any value where the non-characteristic condition fails.

(b) Consider the Cauchy problem

$$u_{y}=v_{x}, \quad v_{y}=-u_{x}$$

with initial data $u(x, 0)=f(x)$ and $v(x, 0)=0$ which are $2 \pi$-periodic in $x$. Give an example of a sequence of smooth solutions $\left(u_{n}, v_{n}\right)$ which are also $2 \pi$-periodic in $x$ whose corresponding initial data $u_{n}(x, 0)=f_{n}(x)$ and $v_{n}(x, 0)=0$ are such that $\int_{0}^{2 \pi}\left|f_{n}(x)\right|^{2} d x \rightarrow 0$ while $\int_{0}^{2 \pi}\left|u_{n}(x, y)\right|^{2} d x \rightarrow \infty$ for non-zero $y$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$

Comment on the significance of this in relation to the concept of well-posedness.
