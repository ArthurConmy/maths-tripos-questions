Define inversion in a circle $\Gamma$ on the Riemann sphere. You should show from your definition that inversion in $\Gamma$ exists and is unique.

Prove that the composition of an even number of inversions is a Möbius transformation of the Riemann sphere and that every Möbius transformation is the composition of an even number of inversions.
