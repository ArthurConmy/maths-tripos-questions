What does it mean to say that a positive definite binary quadratic form is reduced? Find the three smallest positive integers properly represented by each of the forms $f(x, y)=3 x^{2}+8 x y+9 y^{2}$ and $g(x, y)=15 x^{2}+34 x y+20 y^{2}$. Show that every odd integer represented by some positive definite binary quadratic form with discriminant $-44$ is represented by at least one of the forms $f$ and $g$.
