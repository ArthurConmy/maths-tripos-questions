Write an essay on recursive functions. Your essay should include a sketch of why every computable function is recursive, and an explanation of the existence of a universal recursive function, as well as brief discussions of the Halting Problem and of the relationship between recursive sets and recursively enumerable sets.

[You may assume that every recursive function is computable. You do not need to give proofs that particular functions to do with prime-power decompositions are recursive.]
