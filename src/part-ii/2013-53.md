The velocity field $\mathbf{u}$ and stress tensor $\sigma$ satisfy the Stokes equations in a volume $V$ bounded by a surface $S$. Let $\hat{\mathbf{u}}$ be another solenoidal velocity field. Show that

$$\int_{S} \sigma_{i j} n_{j} \hat{u}_{i} d S=\int_{V} 2 \mu e_{i j} \hat{e}_{i j} d V$$

where $\mathbf{e}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{e}}$ are the strain-rates corresponding to the velocity fields $\mathbf{u}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{u}}$ respectively, and $\mathbf{n}$ is the unit normal vector out of $V$. Hence, or otherwise, prove the minimum dissipation theorem for Stokes flow.

A particle moves at velocity $\mathbf{U}$ through a highly viscous fluid of viscosity $\mu$ contained in a stationary vessel. As the particle moves, the fluid exerts a drag force $\mathbf{F}$ on it. Show that

$$-\mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{U}=\int_{V} 2 \mu e_{i j} e_{i j} d V .$$

Consider now the case when the particle is a small cube, with sides of length $\ell$, moving in a very large vessel. You may assume that

$$\mathbf{F}=-k \mu \ell \mathbf{U}$$

for some constant $k$. Use the minimum dissipation theorem, being careful to declare the domain(s) involved, to show that

$$3 \pi \leqslant k \leqslant 3 \sqrt{3} \pi .$$

[You may assume Stokes' result for the drag on a sphere of radius $a, \mathbf{F}=-6 \pi \mu a \mathbf{U}$.]
