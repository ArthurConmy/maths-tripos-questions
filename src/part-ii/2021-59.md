(a) Incompressible fluid of viscosity $\mu$ fills the thin, slowly varying gap between rigid boundaries at $z=0$ and $z=h(x, y)>0$. The boundary at $z=0$ translates in its own plane with a constant velocity $\mathbf{U}=(U, 0,0)$, while the other boundary is stationary. If $h$ has typical magnitude $H$ and varies on a lengthscale $L$, state conditions for the lubrication approximation to be appropriate.

Write down the lubrication equations for this problem and show that the horizontal volume flux $\mathbf{q}=\left(q_{x}, q_{y}, 0\right)$ is given by

$$\mathbf{q}=\frac{\mathbf{U} h}{2}-\frac{h^{3}}{12 \mu} \nabla p$$

where $p(x, y)$ is the pressure.

Explain why $\mathbf{q}=\nabla \wedge(0,0, \psi)$ for some function $\psi(x, y)$. Deduce that $\psi$ satisfies the equation

$$\nabla \cdot\left(\frac{1}{h^{3}} \nabla \psi\right)=-\frac{U}{h^{3}} \frac{\partial h}{\partial y}$$

(b) Now consider the case $\mathbf{U}=\mathbf{0}, h=h_{0}$ for $r>a$ and $h=h_{1}$ for $r<a$, where $h_{0}, h_{1}$ and $a$ are constants, and $(r, \theta)$ are polar coordinates. A uniform pressure gradient $\nabla p=-G \mathbf{e}_{x}$ is applied at infinity. Show that $\psi \sim A r \sin \theta$ as $r \rightarrow \infty$, where the constant $A$ is to be determined.

Given that $a \gg h_{0}, h_{1}$, you may assume that the equations of part (a) apply for $r<a$ and $r>a$, and are subject to conditions that the radial component $q_{r}$ of the volume flux and the pressure $p$ are both continuous across $r=a$. Show that these continuity conditions imply that

$$\left[\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \theta}\right]_{-}^{+}=0 \quad \text { and }\left[\frac{1}{h^{3}} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r}\right]_{-}^{+}=0$$

respectively, where []$_{-}^{+}$denotes the jump across $r=a$.

Hence determine $\psi(r, \theta)$ and deduce that the total flux through $r=a$ is given by

$$\frac{4 A a h_{1}^{3}}{h_{0}^{3}+h_{1}^{3}}$$
