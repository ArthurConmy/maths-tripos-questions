The linearised equation for the growth of a density fluctuation $\delta_{k}$ in a homogeneous and isotropic universe is

$$\frac{d^{2} \delta_{k}}{d t^{2}}+2 \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \frac{d \delta_{k}}{d t}-\left(4 \pi G \rho_{\mathrm{m}}-\frac{v_{s}^{2} k^{2}}{a^{2}}\right) \delta_{k}=0,$$

where $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}$ is the non-relativistic matter density, $k$ is the comoving wavenumber and $v_{s}$ is the sound speed $\left(v_{s}^{2} \equiv d P / d \rho\right)$.

(a) Define the Jeans length $\lambda_{\mathrm{J}}$ and discuss its significance for perturbation growth.

(b) Consider an Einstein-de Sitter universe with $a(t)=\left(t / t_{0}\right)^{2 / 3}$ filled with pressure-free matter $(P=0)$. Show that the perturbation equation $(*)$ can be re-expressed as

$$\ddot{\delta}_{k}+\frac{4}{3 t} \dot{\delta}_{k}-\frac{2}{3 t^{2}} \delta_{k}=0 .$$

By seeking power law solutions, find the growing and decaying modes of this equation.

(c) Qualitatively describe the evolution of non-relativistic matter perturbations $(k>a H)$ in the radiation era, $a(t) \propto t^{1 / 2}$, when $\rho_{\mathrm{r}} \gg \rho_{\mathrm{m}}$. What feature in the power spectrum is associated with the matter-radiation transition?
