Consider a one-parameter family of transformations $q_{i}(t) \mapsto Q_{i}(s, t)$ such that $Q_{i}(0, t)=q_{i}(t)$ for all time $t$, and

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial s} L\left(Q_{i}, \dot{Q}_{i}, t\right)=0$$

where $L$ is a Lagrangian and a dot denotes differentiation with respect to $t$. State and prove Noether's theorem.

Consider the Lagrangian

$$L=\frac{1}{2}\left(\dot{x}^{2}+\dot{y}^{2}+\dot{z}^{2}\right)-V(x+y, y+z),$$

where the potential $V$ is a function of two variables. Find a continuous symmetry of this Lagrangian and construct the corresponding conserved quantity. Use the Euler-Lagrange equations to explicitly verify that the function you have constructed is independent of $t$.
