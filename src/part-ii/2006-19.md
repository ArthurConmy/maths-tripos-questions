Let $\Sigma_{1}$ and $\Sigma_{2}$ be alphabets of sizes $m$ and $a$. What does it mean to say that an $a$-ary code $f: \Sigma_{1} \rightarrow \Sigma_{2}^{*}$ is decipherable? Show that if $f$ is decipherable then the word lengths $s_{1}, \ldots, s_{m}$ satisfy

$$\sum_{i=1}^{m} a^{-s_{i}} \leqslant 1$$

Find a decipherable binary code consisting of codewords 011, 0111, 01111, 11111, and three further codewords of length 2. How do you know the example you have given is decipherable?
