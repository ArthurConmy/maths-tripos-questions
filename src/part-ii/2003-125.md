Let $f: I \rightarrow I$ be a continuous one-dimensional map of the interval $I \subset \mathbb{R}$. Explain what is meant by saying (a) that the map $f$ is topologically transitive, and (b) that the map $f$ has a horseshoe.

Consider the tent map defined on the interval $[0,1]$ by

$$f(x)= \begin{cases}\mu x & 0 \leqslant x<\frac{1}{2} \\ \mu(1-x) & \frac{1}{2} \leqslant x \leqslant 1\end{cases}$$

for $1<\mu \leqslant 2$. Show that if $\mu>\sqrt{2}$ then this map is topologically transitive, and also that $f^{2}$ has a horseshoe.
