In the game of 'Chicken', $A$ and $B$ drive fast cars directly at each other. If they both swerve, they both lose 10 status points; if neither swerves, they both lose 100 status points. If one swerves and the other does not, the swerver loses 20 status points and the non-swerver gains 40 status points. Find all the pairs of probabilistic strategies such that, if one driver maintains their strategy, it is not in the interest of the other to change theirs.
