Write a short essay about periodic orbits in flows in two dimensions. Your essay should include criteria for the existence and non-existence of periodic orbits, and should mention (with sketches) at least two bifurcations that create or destroy periodic orbits in flows as a parameter is altered (though a detailed analysis of any bifurcation is not required).
