(a) State the Arzela-Ascoli theorem, including the definition of equicontinuity.

(b) Consider a sequence $\left(f_{n}\right)$ of continuous real-valued functions on $\mathbb{R}$ such that for all $x \in \mathbb{R},\left(f_{n}(x)\right)$ is bounded and the sequence is equicontinuous at $x$. Prove that there exists $f \in C(\mathbb{R})$ and a subsequence $\left(f_{\varphi(n)}\right)$ such that $f_{\varphi(n)} \rightarrow f$ uniformly on any closed bounded interval.

(c) Let $K$ be a Hausdorff compact topological space, and $C(K)$ the real-valued continuous functions on $K$. Let $\mathcal{K} \subset C(K)$ be a compact subset of $C(K)$. Prove that the collection of functions $\mathcal{K}$ is equicontinuous.

(d) We say that a Hausdorff topological space $X$ is locally compact if every point has a compact neighbourhood. Let $X$ be such a space, $K \subset X$ compact and $U \subset X$ open such that $K \subset U$. Prove that there exists $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ continuous with compact support contained in $U$ and equal to 1 on $K$. [Hint: Construct an open set $V$ such that $K \subset V \subset \bar{V} \subset U$ and $\bar{V}$ is compact, and use Urysohn's lemma to construct a function in $\bar{V}$ and then extend it by zero.]
