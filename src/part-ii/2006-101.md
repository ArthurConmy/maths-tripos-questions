A passenger plane with $N$ numbered seats is about to take off; $N-1$ seats have already been taken, and now the last passenger enters the cabin. The first $N-1$ passengers were advised by the crew, rather imprudently, to take their seats completely at random, but the last passenger is determined to sit in the place indicated on his ticket. If his place is free, he takes it, and the plane is ready to fly. However, if his seat is taken, he insists that the occupier vacates it. In this case the occupier decides to follow the same rule: if the free seat is his, he takes it, otherwise he insists on his place being vacated. The same policy is then adopted by the next unfortunate passenger, and so on. Each move takes a random time which is exponentially distributed with mean $\mu^{-1}$. What is the expected duration of the plane delay caused by these displacements?
