Show that if a continued fraction is periodic, then it represents a quadratic irrational. What number is represented by the continued fraction $[7,7,7, \ldots]$ ?

Compute the continued fraction expansion of $\sqrt{23}$. Hence or otherwise find a solution in positive integers to the equation $x^{2}-23 y^{2}=1$.
