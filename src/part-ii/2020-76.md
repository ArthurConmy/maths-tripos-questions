(i) Define the local connectivity $\kappa(a, b ; G)$ for two non-adjacent vertices $a$ and $b$ in a graph $G$. Prove Menger's theorem, that $G$ contains a set of $\kappa(a, b ; G)$ vertex-disjoint $a-b$ paths.

(ii) Recall that a subdivision $T K_{r}$ of $K_{r}$ is any graph obtained from $K_{r}$ by replacing its edges by vertex-disjoint paths. Let $G$ be a 3 -connected graph. Show that $G$ contains a $T K_{3}$. Show further that $G$ contains a $T K_{4}$. Must $G$ contain a $T K_{5}$?
