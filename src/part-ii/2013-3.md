Let $V \subset \mathbb{A}^{n}$ be an affine variety over an algebraically closed field $k$. What does it mean to say that $V$ is irreducible? Show that any non-empty affine variety $V \subset \mathbb{A}^{n}$ is the union of a finite number of irreducible affine varieties $V_{j} \subset \mathbb{A}^{n}$.

Define the ideal $I(V)$ of $V$. Show that $I(V)$ is a prime ideal if and only if $V$ is irreducible.

Assume that the base field $k$ has characteristic zero. Determine the irreducible components of

$$V\left(X_{1} X_{2}, X_{1} X_{3}+X_{2}^{2}-1, X_{1}^{2}\left(X_{1}-X_{3}\right)\right) \subset \mathbb{A}^{3}$$
