Explain what it means to say that a group $G$ is a Kleinian group. What is the definition of the limit set for the group $G$ ? Prove that a fixed point of a parabolic element in $G$ must lie in the limit set.

Show that the matrix $\left(\begin{array}{cc}1+a w & -a w^{2} \\ a & 1-a w\end{array}\right)$ represents a parabolic transformation for any non-zero choice of the complex numbers $a$ and $w$. Find its fixed point.

The Gaussian integers are $\mathbb{Z}[i]=\{m+i n: m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$. Let $G$ be the set of MÃ¶bius transformations $z \mapsto \frac{a z+b}{c z+d}$ with $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ and $a d-b c=1$. Prove that $G$ is a Kleinian group. For each point $w=\frac{p+i q}{r}$ with $p, q, r$ non-zero integers, find a parabolic transformation $T \in G$ that fixes $w$. Deduce that the limit set for $G$ is all of the Riemann sphere.
