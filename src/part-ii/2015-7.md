State carefully a version of the Seifert-van Kampen theorem for a cover of a space by two closed sets.

Let $X$ be the space obtained by gluing together a MÃ¶bius band $M$ and a torus $T=S^{1} \times S^{1}$ along a homeomorphism of the boundary of $M$ with $S^{1} \times\{1\} \subset T$. Find a presentation for the fundamental group of $X$, and hence show that it is infinite and non-abelian.
