State the conditions for a point $z=z_{0}$ to be a regular singular point of a linear second-order homogeneous ordinary differential equation in the complex plane.

Find all singular points of the Airy equation

$$w^{\prime \prime}(z)-z w(z)=0$$

and determine whether they are regular or irregular.
