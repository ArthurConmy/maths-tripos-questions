(a) Let $X \subseteq \mathbb{A}^{n}$ be an affine algebraic variety. Define the tangent space $T_{p} X$ for $p \in X$. Show that the set

$$\left\{p \in X \mid \operatorname{dim} T_{p} X \geqslant d\right\}$$

is closed, for every $d \geqslant 0$.

(b) Let $C$ be an irreducible projective curve, $p \in C$, and $f: C \backslash\{p\} \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^{n}$ a rational map. Show, carefully quoting any theorems that you use, that if $C$ is smooth at $p$ then $f$ extends to a regular map at $p$.
