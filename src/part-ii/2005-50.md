A rigid body has principal moments of inertia $I_{1}, I_{2}$ and $I_{3}$ and is moving under the action of no forces with angular velocity components $\left(\omega_{1}, \omega_{2}, \omega_{3}\right)$. Its motion is described by Euler's equations

$$\begin{aligned}
&I_{1} \dot{\omega}_{1}-\left(I_{2}-I_{3}\right) \omega_{2} \omega_{3}=0 \\
&I_{2} \dot{\omega}_{2}-\left(I_{3}-I_{1}\right) \omega_{3} \omega_{1}=0 \\
&I_{3} \dot{\omega}_{3}-\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\right) \omega_{1} \omega_{2}=0
\end{aligned}$$

Are the components of the angular momentum to be evaluated in the body frame or the space frame?

Now suppose that an asymmetric body is moving with constant angular velocity $(\Omega, 0,0)$. Show that this motion is stable if and only if $I_{1}$ is the largest or smallest principal moment.
