(a) Define formally what it means for a real valued function $f(x)$ to have an asymptotic expansion about $x_{0}$, given by

$$f(x) \sim \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} f_{n}\left(x-x_{0}\right)^{n} \text { as } x \rightarrow x_{0}$$

Use this definition to prove the following properties.

(i) If both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ have asymptotic expansions about $x_{0}$, then $h(x)=f(x)+g(x)$ also has an asymptotic expansion about $x_{0} .$

(ii) If $f(x)$ has an asymptotic expansion about $x_{0}$ and is integrable, then

$$\int_{x_{0}}^{x} f(\xi) d \xi \sim \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f_{n}}{n+1}\left(x-x_{0}\right)^{n+1} \text { as } x \rightarrow x_{0}$$

(b) Obtain, with justification, the first three terms in the asymptotic expansion as $x \rightarrow \infty$ of the complementary error function, $\operatorname{erfc}(x)$, defined as

$$\operatorname{erfc}(x):=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int_{x}^{\infty} e^{-t^{2}} d t$$
