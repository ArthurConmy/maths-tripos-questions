Given the form

$$T=\frac{1}{2} T_{i j} \dot{q}_{i} \dot{q}_{j}, \quad V=\frac{1}{2} V_{i j} q_{i} q_{j}$$

for the kinetic energy $T$ and potential energy $V$ of a mechanical system, deduce Lagrange's equations of motion.

A light elastic string of length $4 b$, fixed at both ends, has three particles, each of mass $m$, attached at distances $b, 2 b, 3 b$ from one end. Gravity can be neglected. The particles vibrate with small oscillations transversely to the string, the tension $S$ in the string providing the restoring force. Take the displacements of the particles, $q_{i}, i=1,2,3$, to be the generalized coordinates. Take units such that $m=1, S / b=1$ and show that

$$V=\frac{1}{2}\left[q_{1}^{2}+\left(q_{1}-q_{2}\right)^{2}+\left(q_{2}-q_{3}\right)^{2}+{q_{3}}^{2}\right]$$

Find the normal-mode frequencies for this system.
