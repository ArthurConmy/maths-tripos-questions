Define the Legendre symbol $\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)$. State and prove Euler's criterion, assuming if you wish the existence of primitive roots $\bmod p$.

By considering the prime factors of $n^{2}+4$ for $n$ an odd integer, prove that there are infinitely many primes $p$ with $p \equiv 5(\bmod 8)$.
