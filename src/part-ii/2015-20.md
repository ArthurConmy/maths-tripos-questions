(a) Consider a particle of mass $m$ that undergoes periodic motion in a one-dimensional potential $V(q)$. Write down the Hamiltonian $H(p, q)$ for the system. Explain what is meant by the angle-action variables $(\theta, I)$ of the system and write down the integral expression for the action variable $I$.

(b) For $V(q)=\frac{1}{2} m \omega^{2} q^{2}$ and fixed total energy $E$, describe the shape of the trajectories in phase-space. By using the expression for the area enclosed by the trajectory, or otherwise, find the action variable $I$ in terms of $\omega$ and $E$. Hence describe how $E$ changes with $\omega$ if $\omega$ varies slowly with time. Justify your answer.
