(i) Discuss briefly the concept of well-posedness of a Cauchy problem for a partial differential equation.

Solve the Cauchy problem

$$\partial_{2} u+x_{1} \partial_{1} u=a u^{2}, \quad u\left(x_{1}, 0\right)=\phi\left(x_{1}\right),$$

where $a \in \mathbb{R}, \phi \in C^{1}(\mathbb{R})$ and $\partial_{i}$ denotes the partial derivative with respect to $x_{i}$ for $i=1,2$.

For the case $a=0$ show that the solution satisfies $\max _{x_{1} \in \mathbb{R}}\left|u\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)\right|=\|\phi\|_{C^{0}}$, where the $C^{r}$ norm on functions $\phi=\phi\left(x_{1}\right)$ of one variable is defined by

$$\|\phi\|_{C^{r}}=\sum_{i=0}^{r} \max _{x \in \mathbb{R}}\left|\partial_{1}^{i} \phi\left(x_{1}\right)\right|$$

Deduce that the Cauchy problem is then well-posed in the uniform metric (i.e. the metric determined by the $C^{0}$ norm).

(ii) State the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem and deduce that the following Cauchy problem for the Laplace equation,

$$\partial_{1}^{2} u+\partial_{2}^{2} u=0, \quad u\left(x_{1}, 0\right)=0, \partial_{2} u\left(x_{1}, 0\right)=\phi\left(x_{1}\right)$$

has a unique analytic solution in some neighbourhood of $x_{2}=0$ for any analytic function $\phi=\phi\left(x_{1}\right)$. Write down the solution for the case $\phi\left(x_{1}\right)=\sin \left(n x_{1}\right)$, and hence give a sequence of initial data $\left\{\phi_{n}\left(x_{1}\right)\right\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ with the property that

$$\left\|\phi_{n}\right\|_{C^{r}} \rightarrow 0, \quad \text { as } n \rightarrow \infty, \text { for each } r \in \mathbb{N},$$

whereas $u_{n}$, the corresponding solution of $(*)$, satisfies

$$\max _{x_{1} \in \mathbb{R}}\left|u_{n}\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)\right| \rightarrow+\infty, \quad \text { as } n \rightarrow \infty$$

for any $x_{2} \neq 0$.
