The number densities of protons of mass $m_{p}$ or neutrons of mass $m_{n}$ in kinetic equilibrium at temperature $T$, in the absence of any chemical potentials, are each given by (with $i=n$ or $p$ )

$$n_{i}=g_{i}\left(\frac{m_{i} k_{B} T}{2 \pi \hbar^{2}}\right)^{3 / 2} \exp \left[-m_{i} c^{2} / k_{B} T\right]$$

where $k_{B}$ is Boltzmann's constant and $g_{i}$ is the spin degeneracy.

Use this to show, to a very good approximation, that the ratio of the number of neutrons to protons at a temperature $T \simeq 1 \mathrm{MeV} / k_{B}$ is given by

$$\frac{n_{n}}{n_{p}}=\exp \left[-\left(m_{n}-m_{p}\right) c^{2} / k_{B} T\right]$$

where $\left(m_{n}-m_{p}\right) c^{2}=1.3 \mathrm{MeV}$. Explain any approximations you have used.

The reaction rate for weak interactions between protons and neutrons at energies $5 \mathrm{MeV} \geqslant k_{B} T \geqslant 0.8 \mathrm{MeV}$ is given by $\Gamma=\left(k_{B} T / 1 \mathrm{MeV}\right)^{5} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ and the expansion rate of the universe at these energies is given by $H=\left(k_{B} T / 1 M e V\right)^{2} s^{-1}$. Give an example of a weak interaction that can maintain equilibrium abundances of protons and neutrons at these energies. Show how the final abundance of neutrons relative to protons can be calculated and use it to estimate the mass fraction of the universe in helium- 4 after nucleosynthesis.

What would have happened to the helium abundance if the proton and neutron masses had been exactly equal?
