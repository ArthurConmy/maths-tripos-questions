(a) Describe Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Why is it believed to be a secure system?

(b) Consider the following authentication procedure. Alice chooses public key $N$ for the Rabin-Williams cryptosystem. To be sure we are in communication with Alice we send her a 'random item' $r \equiv m^{2} \bmod N$. On receiving $r$, Alice proceeds to decode using her knowledge of the factorisation of $N$ and finds a square root $m_{1}$ of $r$. She returns $m_{1}$ to us and we check $r \equiv m_{1}^{2} \bmod N$. Is this authentication procedure secure? Justify your answer.
