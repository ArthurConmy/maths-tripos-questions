Consider an infinite rigid cylinder of radius a parallel to a horizontal rigid stationary surface. Let $\mathbf{e}_{x}$ be the direction along the surface perpendicular to the cylinder axis, $\mathbf{e}_{y}$ the direction normal to the surface (the surface is at $y=0$ ) and $\mathbf{e}_{z}$ the direction along the axis of the cylinder. The cylinder moves with constant velocity $U \mathbf{e}_{x}$. The minimum separation between the cylinder and the surface is denoted by $h_{0} \ll a$.

(i) What are the conditions for the flow in the thin gap between the cylinder and the surface to be described by the lubrication equations? State carefully the relevant length scale in the $\mathbf{e}_{x}$ direction.

(ii) Without doing any calculation, explain carefully why, in the lubrication limit, the net fluid force $\mathbf{F}$ acting on the stationary surface at $y=0$ has no component in the $\mathbf{e}_{y}$ direction.

(iii) Using the lubrication approximation, calculate the $\mathbf{e}_{x}$ component of the velocity field in the gap between the cylinder and the surface, and determine the pressure gradient as a function of the gap thickness $h(x)$.

(iv) Compute the tangential component of the force, $\mathbf{e}_{x} \cdot \mathbf{F}$, acting on the bottom surface per unit length in the $\mathbf{e}_{z}$ direction.

[You may quote the following integrals:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{d u}{\left(1+u^{2}\right)}=\pi, \quad \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{d u}{\left(1+u^{2}\right)^{2}}=\frac{\pi}{2}, \quad \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{d u}{\left(1+u^{2}\right)^{3}}=\frac{3 \pi}{8}$$
