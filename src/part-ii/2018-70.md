Let $f(t)=t^{4}+b t^{2}+c t+d$ be an irreducible quartic with rational coefficients. Explain briefly why it is that if the cubic $g(t)=t^{3}+2 b t^{2}+\left(b^{2}-4 d\right) t-c^{2}$ has $S_{3}$ as its Galois group then the Galois group of $f(t)$ is $S_{4}$.

For which prime numbers $p$ is the Galois group of $t^{4}+p t+p$ a proper subgroup of $S_{4}$ ? [You may assume that the discriminant of $t^{3}+\lambda t+\mu$ is $-4 \lambda^{3}-27 \mu^{2}$.]
