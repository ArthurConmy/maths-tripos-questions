Define equivalence of binary quadratic forms and show that equivalent forms have the same discriminant.

Show that an integer $n$ is properly represented by a binary quadratic form of discriminant $d$ if and only if $x^{2} \equiv d \bmod 4 n$ is soluble in integers. Which primes are represented by a form of discriminant $-20$ ?

What does it mean for a positive definite form to be reduced? Find all reduced forms of discriminant $-20$. For each member of your list find the primes less than 100 represented by the form.
