An incompressible fluid of density $\rho$ and kinematic viscosity $\nu$ is confined in a channel with rigid stationary walls at $y=\pm h$. A spatially uniform pressure gradient $-G \cos \omega t$ is applied in the $x$-direction. What is the physical significance of the dimensionless number $S=\omega h^{2} / \nu ?$

Assuming that the flow is unidirectional and time-harmonic, obtain expressions for the velocity profile and the total flux. [You may leave your answers as the real parts of complex functions.]

In each of the limits $S \rightarrow 0$ and $S \rightarrow \infty$, find and sketch the flow profiles, find leading-order asymptotic expressions for the total flux, and give a physical interpretation.

Suppose now that $G=0$ and that the channel walls oscillate in their own plane with velocity $U \cos \omega t$ in the $x$-direction. Without explicit calculation of the solution, sketch the flow profile in each of the limits $S \rightarrow 0$ and $S \rightarrow \infty$.
