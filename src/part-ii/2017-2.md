(a) Let $X$ and $Y$ be non-singular projective curves over a field $k$ and let $\varphi: X \rightarrow Y$ be a non-constant morphism. Define the ramification degree $e_{P}$ of $\varphi$ at a point $P \in X$.

(b) Suppose char $k \neq 2$. Let $X=Z(f)$ be the plane cubic with $f=x_{0} x_{2}^{2}-x_{1}^{3}+x_{0}^{2} x_{1}$, and let $Y=\mathbb{P}^{1}$. Explain how the projection

$$\left(x_{0}: x_{1}: x_{2}\right) \mapsto\left(x_{0}: x_{1}\right)$$

defines a morphism $\varphi: X \rightarrow Y$. Determine the degree of $\varphi$ and the ramification degrees $e_{P}$ for all $P \in X$.

(c) Let $X$ be a non-singular projective curve and let $P \in X$. Show that there is a non-constant rational function on $X$ which is regular on $X \backslash\{P\}$.
