Write down the linearized equations governing motion in an inviscid compressible fluid and, assuming an adiabatic relationship $p=p(\rho)$, derive the wave equation for the velocity potential $\phi(\mathbf{x}, t)$. Obtain from these linearized equations the energy equation

$$\frac{\partial E}{\partial t}+\nabla \cdot \mathbf{I}=0$$

and give expressions for the acoustic energy density $E$ and the acoustic intensity, or energyflux vector, I.

An inviscid compressible fluid occupies the half-space $y>0$, and is bounded by a very thin flexible membrane of negligible mass at an undisturbed position $y=0$. Small acoustic disturbances with velocity potential $\phi(x, y, t)$ in the fluid cause the membrane to be deflected to $y=\eta(x, t)$. The membrane is supported by springs that, in the deflected state, exert a restoring force $K \eta \delta x$ on an element $\delta x$ of the membrane. Show that the dispersion relation for waves proportional to $\exp (i k x-i \omega t)$ propagating freely along the membrane is

$$\left(k^{2}-\frac{\omega^{2}}{c_{0}^{2}}\right)^{1 / 2}-\frac{\rho_{0} \omega^{2}}{K}=0$$

where $\rho_{0}$ is the density of the fluid and $c_{0}$ is the sound speed. Show that in such a wave the component $\left\langle I_{y}\right\rangle$ of mean acoustic intensity perpendicular to the membrane is zero.
