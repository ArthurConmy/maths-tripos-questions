(i) A dynamical system is described by the Hamiltonian $H\left(q_{i}, p_{i}\right)$. Define the Poisson bracket $\{f, g\}$ of two functions $f\left(q_{i}, p_{i}, t\right), g\left(q_{i}, p_{i}, t\right)$. Assuming the Hamiltonian equations of motion, find an expression for $d f / d t$ in terms of the Poisson bracket.

(ii) A one-dimensional system has the Hamiltonian

$$H=p^{2}+\frac{1}{q^{2}}$$

Show that $u=p q-2 H t$ is a constant of the motion. Deduce the form of $(q(t), p(t))$ along a classical path, in terms of the constants $u$ and $H$.
