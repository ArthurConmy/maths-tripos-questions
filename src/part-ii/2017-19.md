Consider the function

$$f_{\nu}(x) \equiv \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{C} \exp [-i x \sin z+i \nu z] d z$$

where the contour $C$ is the boundary of the half-strip $\{z:-\pi<\operatorname{Re} z<\pi$ and $\operatorname{Im} z>0\}$, taken anti-clockwise.

Use integration by parts and the method of stationary phase to:

(i) Obtain the leading term for $f_{\nu}(x)$ coming from the vertical lines $z=\pm \pi+i y(0<$ $y<+\infty)$ for large $x>0$.

(ii) Show that the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the function $f_{\nu}(x)$ for large positive $x$ is

$$\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi x}} \cos \left(x-\frac{1}{2} \nu \pi-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)$$

and obtain an estimate for the remainder as $O\left(x^{-a}\right)$ for some $a$ to be determined.
