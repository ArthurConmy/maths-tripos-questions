(i) Define the minimum path and the maximum tension problems for a network with span intervals specified for each arc. State without proof the connection between the two problems, and describe the Max Tension Min Path algorithm of solving them.

(ii) Find the minimum path between nodes $\mathbf{S}$ and $\mathbf{S}^{\prime}$ in the network below. The span intervals are displayed alongside the arcs.
