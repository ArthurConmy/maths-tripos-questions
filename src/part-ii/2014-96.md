(i) Show that each prime ideal in a number field $K$ divides a unique rational prime $p$. Define the ramification index and residue class degree of such an ideal. State and prove a formula relating these numbers, for all prime ideals dividing a given rational prime $p$, to the degree of $K$ over $\mathbb{Q}$.

(ii) Show that if $\zeta_{n}$ is a primitive $n$th root of unity then $\prod_{j=1}^{n-1}\left(1-\zeta_{n}^{j}\right)=n$. Deduce that if $n=p q$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes, then $1-\zeta_{n}$ is a unit in $\mathbb{Z}\left[\zeta_{n}\right]$.

(iii) Show that if $K=\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_{p}\right)$ where $p$ is prime, then any prime ideal of $K$ dividing $p$ has ramification index at least $p-1$. Deduce that $[K: \mathbb{Q}]=p-1$.
